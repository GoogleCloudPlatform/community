# This is a sample Cloud Build configuration file that builds a Docker image,
# passing in the current project as the project_id build arg. Note that the
# configuration uses Cloud Build's built-in $PROJECT_ID substitution for this.
#
# You may also optionally pass the Docker image tag via the _TAG substitution.


# This build script has only one step, a docker build, using Cloud Build's
# provided Docker build step. The arguments are passed to the docker CLI.
steps:
- name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker"
  args: ["build", "-t", "gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/hello:$_TAG",
         "--build-arg", "project_id=$PROJECT_ID", "."]

# Upload the built image to Google Container Registry
images:
- "gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/hello:$_TAG"

# Specify a default value for the _TAG substitution.
substitutions:
- _TAG: latest
