This tutorial describes how to implement a multi-site container registry design with [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) and
[Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/). In this tutorial, you set up one-way, push-based replication of container images from
Harbor to Google Container Registry.

It's becoming increasingly common to need to deploy a single application system across multiple sites. These different sites could be different public 
clouds (multi-cloud) or a combination of public and on-premises data centers (hybrid cloud).

Having container registries local to the Kubernetes clusters at multiple sites speeds the retrieval of application container images by decreasing latency and 
increasing bandwidth, and it prevents a single container registry from being a single point of failure for the application running across independent Kubernetes 
clusters.

Using different container registries for different clusters has a downstream impact, because the Kubernetes deployment manifests deployed to each cluster need to 
use different fully qualified image names. This challenge can be addressed with different templating tools (such Helm, kpt, or Kustomize) but this is out of 
scope for this tutorial. A simple solution using shell scripting is provided at the end of this tutorial for reference and adaptation.

**Note**: As of May 2021, Google Artifact Registry is not supported by Harbor as an external registry endpoint.

## Install Harbor and its prerequisites

This tutorial uses a single-node installation of Harbor on Compute Engine. You can use any Compute Engine virtual machine with at least 2 vCPUs, with
**Allow HTTPS traffic** enabled under **Firewall**.

**Note**: For a highly available installation on Anthos instead, you can use the instructions for
[deploying Harbor with high availability with Helm](https://goharbor.io/docs/2.2.0/install-config/harbor-ha-helm/), which also requires setting up HA 
clusters of PostgreSQL and Redis.

1.  Install the [prerequisites for Harbor](https://goharbor.io/docs/2.2.0/install-config/installation-prereqs/), including Docker Engine and Docker Compose.

1.  Follow the instructions for [installing and configuring Harbor](https://goharbor.io/docs/latest/install-config/). 

1.  For the Harbor HTTPS configuration, use the internal Compute Engine hostname as your fully qualified domain name (FQDN). When you're logged in
    to the VM, set the environment variable `$HARBOR` to this value with the following command:

        HARBOR=$(curl "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/hostname" -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google")

1.  After installation is complete, test that you can access the Harbor user interface by browsing to `https://[VM_EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS]`.

    The default username is `admin`. The default password is `admin/Harbor12345`.

1.  Confirm that you can log in to Docker with the same credentials:

        docker login $HARBOR
        
    This command should return `Login Successful`.

## Set up the Google Container Registry endpoint for Harbor

1.  In the Cloud Console, go to the [**IAM & Admin > Service Accounts** page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) and
    [create a Google Cloud service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating) with the `Storage Admin` role.
1.  Click the key name and select the **Keys** tab.
1.  Under **Add key**, select **Create a new key** and **JSON**.

    This creates a new key and downloads it to your local machine.

1.  In Harbor, go to **Administration > Registries > New Endpoint** and fill in the following details in the **Edit Endpoint** dialog box:

    - **Provider**: Choose **Google GCR**.
    - **Name**: Your endpoint name. This tutorial uses `gcr-sea-anthos-demo`.
    - **Description**: A description for your endpoint.
    - **Endpoint URL**: `https://gcr.io`
    - **Access ID**: `_json_key`
    - **Access Secret**: Paste your Google Cloud IAM service account JSON key content in this field.
    - **Verify Remote Cert**: Check this box.

1.  Click **Test Connection**.
1.  Click **OK**.

## Set up replication

In Harbor, go to **Administration > Replications > New Replication Rule**, fill in the following details in the **Edit Replication Rule** dialog box, and then
click **Save**:

- **Name**: Your replication rule name. This tutorial uses `replicate-library-to-gcr`. 
- **Description**: A description for your replication rule.
- **Replication Mode**: Select **Push-based**, which means that Harbor is the primary container registry that new images are pushed to, soÂ replication to other 
  sites should be triggered when new images are pushed to Harbor.
- **Source resource filter**:
  - **Name**: `[LIBRARY_NAME]/**`. For example, if you use `library/**` as the filter, all images under `library` are replicated.

    For more example filter patterns, see
    [Creating a replication rule](https://goharbor.io/docs/1.10/administration/configuring-replication/create-replication-rules/#replication-rule3:~:text=The%20name%20filter%20and%20tag%20filters%20support%20the%20following%20patterns).
  - **Tag**: (optional) Filter based on image tag/version.
  - **Label**: (optional) Filter based on Harbor labels.
  - **Resource**: **Image**. Only replicate container images to Google Container Registry.
- **Destination registry**: Name of the registry endpoint that you created in the previous section.
- **Destination namespace**: `[YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_NAME]/[OPTIONAL_GOOGLE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_LIBRARY_NAME]`. The Google Cloud project name is mandatory. If
  you also specify a subdirectory with the library name, then all source images will be stored in this subdirectory.
- **Trigger Mode**: Select **Event Based**.
- **Delete remote resources when locally deleted**: Check this box to keep Google Container Registry fully synchronized.
- **Override**: Check this box to replace (overwrite) an image at the destination when an image of the same name exists.
- **Enable rule**: Check this box.                                                                                                            
    
Harbor does not support subdirectories under the library. If a container is stored in Harbor with `.../...` in the name, the subdirectory name will be
removed. For example, `library/private/nginx` will be replicated to `[DESTINATION_NAMESPACE]/nginx`, with the `private` subdirectory dropped.

## Test replication

To test replication, pull a public `nginx` image, tag it, and push it to Harbor:

    $docker pull nginx:latest
    $docker tag nginx:latest $HARBOR/library/private-reg/nginx:latest
    $docker push $HARBOR/library/private-reg/nginx:latest
    
The image is automatically replicated to Google Container Registry.

The screenshots below show the state of Harbor and Google Container Registry after a new image is pushed to the local Harbor registry, and automatic 
synchronization is successful.

## Updating image registry path in image name

You can use the example code in this section to replace repository URLs in fully qualified image names.

This example replaces `registry.private.com/lib/nginx:v1.1` with `gcr.io/lib/nginx:v1.1`:

    # export OLD_IMG="registry.private.com/lib/nginx:v1.1"
    $ export NEW_REPO="gcr.io\/lib\/"

    $ NEW_IMG=`echo $OLD_IMG | sed "s/^\(.*\/\)\(.*\)/${NEW_REPO}\2/"`
    $ echo $NEW_IMG
    
    gcr.io/lib/nginx:v1.1
