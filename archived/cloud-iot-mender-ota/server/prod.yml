# this is a template file for production setup, consult
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/ for details on syntax and usage
#
# Notes:
# - integration/docker-compose.yml file is assumed to be included
# - integration/docker-compose.storage.minio.yml is assumed to be included
# - all services are part of `mender` network (service names are unchanged)
# - keys and certificates are generated using keygen utility from integration
#   repository, keys and certificates are stored in ./keys-generated directory
# - certificates and key are mounted into containers using volumes
# - minio artifacts are stored in a named volume `mender-artifacts`; volume
#   needs to be created manually using `docker volume create mender-artifacts`
# - paths need to be adjusted, ie, replace /production/ with production directory
