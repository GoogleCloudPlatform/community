This tutorial shows a sample [Swift][swift] app built with [Kitura][kitura]
deployed to the Google App Engine flexible environment.

Kitura is "a high performance and simple to use web framework for
building modern Swift applications." It is [open source on GitHub][kitura-github].

This tutorial assumes basic familiarity with Swift programming.

## Objectives

+ Create a Swift "Hello, world" app that uses the Kitura framework.
+ Deploy the app to the App Engine flexible environment.

## Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud Platform, including:

+ Google App Engine flexible environment

Use the [Pricing Calculator][pricing] to generate a cost estimate based on your
projected usage.

## Before you begin

1.  Create a project in the [Google Cloud Platform Console][console].
1.  Enable billing for your project.
1.  Install the [Google Cloud SDK][cloud-sdk].

## Handling dependencies

We'll use the [Swift Package Manager][spm] to manage our app's dependencies.

1.  Create a `package.swift` file with the following contents:

        import PackageDescription

        let package = Package(
            name: "KituraGAE",
            targets: [
                Target(name: "KituraGAE", dependencies: [])
            ],
            dependencies: [
                .Package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura.git", majorVersion: 1, minor: 3),
            ]
        )

## Writing the server

1.  Create a `main.swift` file with the following contents:

        import Foundation
        import Kitura

        // All apps need a Router instance
        let router = Router()

        // Respond to App Engine health check requests
        ...

        // Basic GET request
        ...

        // Start server on 8080
        Kitura.addHTTPServer(onPort: 8080, with: router)
        Kitura.run()

1.  Create a route to handle App Engine health-check requests (per the [custom runtime docs][custom-runtime]):

        // Respond to App Engine health check requests
        router.all("/_ah/health") { request, response, _ in
            print("ALL - /_ah/health route handler...")
            try response.send("OK").end()
        }

1.  Create a route to handle `GET` requests to `/hello`:

        // Basic GET request
        router.get("/hello") { request, response, _ in
            print("GET - /hello route handler...")
            try response.status(.OK).send("Hello from Swift on Google App Engine flexible environment!").end()
        }

## Creating the `Dockerfile`

Since Swift doesn't have an officially supported App Engine runtime, we'll create our
own.

1.  Create a `Dockerfile` with the following contents:

        FROM ibmcom/swift-ubuntu:latest
        LABEL Description="Docker image for Swift + Kitura on Google App Engine flexible environment."

        # Expose default port for App Engine
        EXPOSE 8080

        # Copy sources
        RUN mkdir /root/KituraGAE
        ADD main.swift /root/KituraGAE
        ADD Package.swift /root/KituraGAE

        # Build the app
        RUN cd /root/KituraGAE && swift build

        # Run the app
        USER root
        CMD ["/root/KituraGAE/.build/debug/KituraGAE"]

## Deploying the app

1.  Create an `app.yaml` file with the following contents:

        runtime: custom
        env: flex

1.  Run the following command to deploy your app. It might take several minutes:

        gcloud app deploy

1.  Visit `http://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot.com/hello` to see the deployed app.

            Replace `[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]` with your Google Cloud Platform project ID.

If all goes well, you should see "Hello from Swift on Google App Engine flexible environment!".
