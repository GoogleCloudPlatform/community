Datastore-Entity Tutorial with Flask Login
Flask Login requires a User class 
Most Flask usage requires the use of models(with sql-alchemy)
Datastore Entity library helps you represent your datastore entity using Python classes(just like a relational database model)

To easily represent your user entity as a class, we'll use a 
library called datastore-entity(disclaimer: I authored this library. No Google affiliation)

pip install flask-login 
pip install datastore-entity
