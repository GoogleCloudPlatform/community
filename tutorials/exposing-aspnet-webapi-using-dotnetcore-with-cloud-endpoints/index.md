This tutorial shows how to create a simple API using ASP.NET Core Web API,
deploy that API to the App Engine flexible environment, then use Cloud Endpoints
to expose and monitor the API.

## Step 1 - Setup your development environment

You will write code using Visual Studio Code. Therefore, you should install the
following:

* [.NET Core 2.0.0 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [OmniSharp C# extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)

## Step 2 - Create ASP.NET Core Web API using VS Code

1.  Open a command-line prompt and run the following commands:

        mkdir ExposeAPIWithEndpointsCore
        cd ExposeAPIWithEndpointsCore
        dotnet new webapi

    This will create a template Web API project using .NET Core 2.0.

1.  Open the `ExposeAPIWithEndpointsCore` folder you created in Visual Studio
    Code. It will look like this:

    ![VS Code First Screen](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/exposing-aspnet-webapi-using-dotnetcore-with-cloud-endpoints/VSCodeEndpointsFirstScreen.png)

1.  Click on *"YES"* for **"Required assets to build and debug are missing from
    ExposeAPIWithEndpointsCore. Add them?"**

1.  Press `F5` to build the template project.

1.  Navigate to [http://localhost:5000/api/values](http://localhost:5000/api/values)
    in your browser.

    This is the output you should expect: **[“value1”, “value2”].**

    Now we have a pre-built `"Values"` controller in our sample project that
    exposes five HTTP REST APIs. Now we need to add OpenAPI support.

    OpenAPI is a set of specifications that describe REST APIs. It’s a format
    that is both machine and human readable. Originally this set of
    specifications was called **Swagger** but it was later renamed to OpenAPI.
    You can [read more](https://swagger.io/blog/getting-started-with-swagger-i-what-is-swagger/)
    to understand the idea behind OpenAPI.

    We need it to deploy API specification to Google Endpoints later on. We have
    two options - either create OpenAPI specification manually, or
    [use Swashbuckle tool](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore)
    that will auto-generate the specifications for us based on API definition.
    Of course, I prefer the second option. You will find it beneficial over
    time, as you make changes to the API. To add it, we need to add a few nuget
    packages: [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/swashbuckle.aspnetcore/)
    and [Swagger](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Swashbuckle/) and then
    configure Swagger in our service startup.

1.  In VS Code terminal, type this:

        dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore

1.  Make changes in *Startup.cs*.

    1.  In `"using"` section at the start of the document, add this:

            using Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger;

    2.  In `ConfigureServices` method, add this:

            public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
            {
                services.AddMvc();

                // Register the Swagger generator
                services.AddSwaggerGen(c =>
                {
                    c.SwaggerDoc(
                        "v1",
                        new Info { Title = "My API", Version = "v1" });
                });
            }

    1.  In `"Configure"` method, add this:

            public void Configure(
                IApplicationBuilder app,
                IHostingEnvironment env)
            {
              if (env.IsDevelopment())
              {
                  app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
              }

              // Enable middleware to serve generated Swagger as a JSON endpoint.
              app.UseSwagger();

              // Enable middleware to serve swagger-ui (HTML, JS, CSS, etc.), specifying the Swagger JSON endpoint.
              app.UseSwaggerUI(c =>
              {
                  c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "My API V1");
              });

              app.UseMvc();
            }

## Step 3 - Create OpenAPI specification for our API

1.  Press `F5` in VS Code. Browse to [http://localhost:5000/swagger/v1/swagger.json](http://localhost:5000/swagger/v1/swagger.json)

    You should see Open API specification for our APIs in JSON format. However
    we will work with YAML representation of the same JSON. Even though Google
    Endpoints supports both json and YAML representations of OpenAPI, YAML is
    much more human friendly, so in case we will want to make manual changes to
    the specification, doing it in YAML file will be easier.

1.  Copy the JSON content from the browser and paste it into [https://editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io).
    You will be asked whether to translate JSON to YAML. Say `YES`. You will see
    this:

    ![Swagger Editor](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/exposing-aspnet-webapi-using-dotnetcore-with-cloud-endpoints/SwaggerYamlFromEditor.io.png)

1.  Create a new file in VS Code under the main folder
    `ExposeApiWithEndpointsCore`. Name it `openapi.yaml` and paste the content
    of the generated YAML from https://editor.swagger.io.

    Now we are ready to deploy the API to Google Cloud Platform!

## Step 4 - Create a new GCP Project

1.  [Create a new project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project)
    at https://console.cloud.google.com

    We will create App Engine Flexible Environment and deploy our API to it from
    the command line. So now we need to make sure that Google Cloud SDK is
    preconfigured to work with the project we just created.

1.  Open Google Cloud SDK command line in elevated mode (Administrator), and
    type the following:

    1.  Update SDK components to the latest

            gcloud components update

    1.  Make sure that gcloud has permissions to work with our cloud project.

            gcloud auth login

        This will open a new browser window where you need to authenticate using
        your user account.

    1.  Configure default project for all subsequent commands we will execute:

            gcloud config set project `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`

    1.  Create [App Engine flexible environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/)
        to which we will deploy our API. You can find the list of supported
        regions [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/locations).

            gcloud app create --project --region=`YOUR_REGION`

Now it's time to deploy the API specification and API implementation.

## Step 5 - Deploy API Specification to Google Endpoints

1.  Open `openapi.yaml` that was created in step 3.

1.  Add `host` declaration right before the `paths` section. The value should be
    `YOUR-PROJECT-ID.appspot.com` (replace `YOUR-PROJECT-ID` with your Cloud
    project ID):

        swagger: '2.0'
        info:
        version: v1
        title: My API
        host: YOUR-PROJECT-ID.appspot.com
        paths:
          /api/Values:
        get:
            tags:
            - Values
            operationId: ApiValuesGet

    When you will deploy API specification to Google Endpoints, it will create a
    new Cloud Endpoints service configuration with the name equals to `host`
    value from our `OpenAPI yaml`. Each endpoints deployment assigns a unique
    `configuration_id` for versioning purposes. When we will deploy the service
    implementation to App Engine flexible environment in the next step, it will
    create a DNS entry in the format of `YOUR-PROJECT_ID.appspot.com`. We should
    use that FQDN to make incoming requests to our API.

1.  In Google SDK command prompt, make sure you are in the folder that contains
    `openapi.yaml` that was created in step 3. Execute:

        gcloud endpoints services deploy openapi.yaml

    You should notice that the deployment shows a few warnings, such as
    `Operation does not require an API Key`. You can ignore these for now.

    So what has happened now? You just deployed API specification. This created
    a new Cloud Endpoints service configuration entry with the name that we
    specified in `“host”` field of `openapi.yaml`. This service entry is
    preconfigured to serve the API based on the specifications in yaml file. Now
    we want to ensure that all incoming API calls will be intercepted by Cloud
    Endpoints and then routed for execution to the service we deploy to App
    Engine flexible environment.

## Step 6 - Deploy API implementation to App Engine flexible environment

Now you need to deploy API implementation. You also need to bind API
specification we deployed earlier to API implementation instance, so that every
incoming request passes through Cloud Endpoints service first, before it hits
the deployment of API implementation.

When deploying App Engine flexible service, you should specify Endpoints service
name in the `app.yaml`. You should also set deployment rollout strategy to
managed. By doing that, you instruct App Engine flexible environment to place an
instance of Cloud Endpoints service in front of your API implementation. That
instance is identified by service name and configuration id. By setting
`rollout_strategy=managed` in `app.yaml`, we instruct the service to always use
latest version of Cloud Endpoints service (the one that was deployed last).

1.  In Google Cloud SDK shell type:

        gcloud endpoints configs list --service=`YOUR-PROJECT-ID`.appspot.com

    The output will show the `CONFIG_ID` and `SERVICE_NAME`.

1.  Create `app.yaml` file in VS Code at `ExploreApiWithEndpointsCore` directory.
    The content of the file should be:

        Runtime: aspnetcore
        env: flex
        endpoints_api_service:
          name: [SERVICE_NAME]
          rollout_strategy: managed

    Replace `[SERVICE_NAME]` with corresponding value of previous command output.

    By creating `app.yaml` with `endpoints_api_service` section, we effectively
    created the binding that will ensure that every incoming request to our API
    (specification is detailed in configuration with config_id) that will hit
    `YOUR-PROJECT-ID.appspot.com` (“name”), will be routed to our service.

    Now you are almost ready to deploy API implementation into AppEngine Flex.
    In order to separate a project from its publish package in dotnet core, you
    should deploy the outcome of `dotnet publish` command. That output by
    default doesn’t contain `app.yaml` file we created earlier.

1.  Edit `“ExposeAPIWithEndpointsCore.csproj”` in Visual Studio Code so that it
    always copies `app.yaml` into the publish directory by adding the content in
    [this file](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/community/blob/master/tutorials/exposing-aspnet-webapi-using-dotnetcore-with-cloud-endpoints/add_this_to_csproj.xml) to your
    `ExposeAPIWithEndpointsCore.csproj` file right before the closing `Project`
    tag.

1.  Deploy API implementation to the App Engine flexible environment.

        dotnet publish
        gcloud beta app deploy bin\debug\netcoreapp2.0\publish\app.yaml

1. Test that your APIs are exposed properly. Open
    `https://[YOUR-PROJECT-ID].appspot.com/api/Values` in any browser. If you
    get **["value1","value2"]** back, you are done!

## Verifying the deployment

You now have the API deployed and exposed via Cloud Endpoints! To verify that,
go to [Endpoints](https://console.cloud.google.com/endpoints) page of Google
Cloud Console. There you can inspect the requests graph, which should reflect
the requests you make to test the API. You can also view all of the
configurations of your endpoints deployments.

## Summary

You created a basic ASP.NET Core Web API, deployed it to App Engine flexible
environment on Google Cloud Platform and configured Cloud Endpoints in front of
the API, so all the incoming requests will be sent to Cloud Endpoints which in
turn will route them to API implementation. You haven’t implemented all the
non functional requirements of exposing the API like security, throttling and
monitoring yet. In this tutorial the API is exposed to everyone without any
authentication.
