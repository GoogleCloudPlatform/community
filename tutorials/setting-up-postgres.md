This tutorial shows how to set up [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) on Google Cloud. Follow this tutorial to configure
PostgreSQL on an Ubuntu virtual machine instance on Compute Engine.

If you don't want to install and manage your own PostgreSQL database,
[Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/) provides managed PostgreSQL.

Alternatively, you can use options from the
[Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?q=postgre) to deploy a PostgreSQL stack automatically.

## Objectives

* Install PostgreSQL on a Compute Engine instance.
* Configure PostgreSQL for remote access.
* Configure a Google Cloud firewall to open a port.
* Connect to PostgreSQL from a remote computer.

## Before you begin

You'll need a Google Cloud project. You can use an existing project or
[create a new project](https://console.cloud.google.com/project).

## Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud,
including [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/all-pricing).

Use the [pricing calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/)
to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage. New Google Cloud users might be
eligible for a [free trial](https://cloud.google.com/free-trial).

## Create a Compute Engine instance

For the purposes of this tutorial, the default machine type works fine, so
you don't need to change the default setting.
In production, you need to decide how much computing power is required
for your application. In general, database systems tend to be more
constrained by I/O bottlenecks and hard disk speed than by CPU capabilities.

Most Linux distributions have some version of PostgreSQL integrated with
their package managers. For this tutorial, you use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) because
it includes PostgreSQL 12.5, which has some helpful tools that aren't
available in earlier versions.

1. In the Cloud Console, go to the [**VM instances**](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) page.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Set **Name** to `postgres-tutorial`.
1. In the **Public images** tab, choose **Ubuntu** for **Operating system**.
1. In the **Version** dropdown list, choose **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.
1. In the **Boot disk type** section, select **Standard persistent disk**.
1. Click **Select**.
1. Under the **Firewall** section, expand **Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy**, select the **Networking** tab, and
   enter `postgres-tutorial` for the **Network tags** field.
1. Click **Create** to create the instance.

It will take a few moments to create your new instance.

Stay on the **VM instances** page for the next step.

## Setting up PostgreSQL

To set up PostgreSQL, you must install it and set up a user.

### Install PostgreSQL

Follow these steps to install PostgreSQL on your Compute Engine instance.

1.  In the list of virtual machine instances, click the **SSH** button in the row of the instance to which you want to connect.
1.  Update the packages. In the SSH terminal, enter the following command:

        sudo apt update

1.  Install PostgreSQL, including the PSQL client and server instrumentation:

        sudo apt -y install postgresql postgresql-client postgresql-contrib

### Use PSQL to complete the setup

PostgreSQL created a default user, named `postgres`, during installation. This
user doesn't yet have a password, so you need to set one.

1.  Run [PSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-psql.html)
    as user `postgres`, instead of `root`, accessing the database
    named `postgres`:

        sudo -u postgres psql postgres

    You should see the PSQL command prompt, which looks like this: `postgres=#`

1.  Enter the following command to set the password:

        \password postgres

1.  When prompted, enter and confirm the password you've chosen.

    **Important**: For any system with an Internet connection, use a strong
    password to help keep the system secure.

1.  Install the `adminpack` extension to enable the server instrumentation that
    you installed earlier. The console prints `CREATE EXTENSION` when successful.

        CREATE EXTENSION adminpack;

1.  Enter `\q` to exit PSQL.

1.  Enter `exit` to exit the root shell.

## Connecting remotely

To connect to your Postgres database, you need to change a configuration
file and open a port in the firewall on Google Cloud.

### Configure PostgreSQL remote access

By default, Postgres doesn't allow remote connections. To change this setting,
you can change the file named
[`pg_hba.conf`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

**Caution**: On production systems, or any
system that has an internet connection, use strong
authentication methods and restrict traffic to only those users and IP addresses
that you want to connect to each database.

#### Edit `pg_hba.conf`

1.  In the SSH terminal window, edit `pg_hba.conf`. This tutorial uses the
    `nano` editor, but you can substitute your favorite editor. For PostgreSQL
    version 9.3, you can enter:

        sudo nano /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf

1.  Navigate to [ip4.me](http://ip4.me) to get the IPv4
    address of your local computer.

    You need this IP address in an upcoming steps.

1.  Scroll down to the bottom of the file and add the following lines:

        # IPv4 remote connections for the tutorial:
        host    all             all           [YOUR_IPV4_ADDRESS]/32         md5

    Replace `[YOUR_IPV4_ADDRESS]` with the address of your local computer. Note
    that the [CIDR](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
    suffix `/32` is used for a single address, which is what you're providing in this tutorial.

1.  Save the file and exit the editor. In nano, press `Control+x` and then
    use the `Return` key to accept the prompts to save the file. Note that nano
    might not clear the console screen properly, so if you have trouble reading the
    text in the console after closing nano, enter `clear` to clear the screen.

#### Edit `postgresql.conf`

1.  Open [`postgresql.conf`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/config-setting.html) for editing.

    For example, enter the following command:

        sudo nano /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf

1.  Scroll down to the line that begins with `#listen_addresses = 'localhost'`.

1.  Delete the `#` character to uncomment the line.

1.  Replace `localhost` with `*`:

        listen_addresses = '*'

    The `'*'` setting enables Postgres to listen on all IP addresses. This is
    a commonly used setting. When you set the IP address in `hba.conf` in the
    previous step, you restricted access to the database to only your computer.

1.  Save the file and exit the editor.

1.  Restart the database service. In the SSH terminal, enter:

        sudo service postgresql restart

### Open the network port

PostgreSQL accepts remote connections on port 5432. Follow these steps to add
a firewall rule that enables traffic on this port.

1.  In the Cloud Console, navigate to the
    [**Create a firewall rule** page](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/firewalls/add)**.

1.  In the **Name** field, enter `postgres-tutorial`.

1.  In the **Network** field, leave the network as **default**.

1.  In the **Direction of traffic** field, select **Ingress**.

1.  In the **Action on match** field, select **Allow**.

1.  In the **Target tags** field, enter the network tag (`postgres-tutorial`) that you used for the instance.

1.  In **Source IP Ranges**, enter the same IP address that you used in `hba.conf`.

    This is the IP address of your local computer. Remember to include the `/32`
    suffix, for example: `1.2.3.4/32`.

1.  In **Specified protocols and ports**, check **tcp**, and enter `5432` for the value.

1.  Click **Create**.

Firewall rules are a global resource, so you'll only need to create this rule once for all instances.

### Connect using pgAdmin

Now you can connect to your PostgreSQL database from your computer. This
tutorial uses [pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/), which is a
popular client application for working
with Postgres databases.

1.  Install [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) on your local computer.

1.  (macOS only) Move pgAdmin to a location from which you can run it:

    1.  Right-click the pgAdmin icon and copy it.
    1.  Open the macOS `Application` folder, and paste pgAdmin into this folder.
    
1.  Start pgAdmin by clicking its icon in the `Application` folder.

1.  Add the server. In pgAdmin4, you can click the first icon on the left
    side of the toolbar. Alternatively, click **File** > **Add server**.

1.  In the **New Server Registration** window, in the **Name** field, enter the following:

        Postgres tutorial

1.  On the [**VM instances** page](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances), find the external IP address of
    your Compute Engine instance in the **External IP** column.

1.  In pgAdmin, in the **Connection** tab, in the **Hostname/address** field, enter the external IP address of your Compute Engine
    instance.

    **Note**: Enter only the address as it appears in the Cloud Console;
    don't add any protocol specifiers, such as `http://` or other characters.

1.  In the **Port** field, enter `5432`.

1.  In the **Password** field, enter the password that you set previously for the user named `postgres`.

1.  Click **Save** to close the window.

You should now be connected to your PostgreSQL database that is hosted on your
Compute Engine instance. You can use pgAdmin to browse and modify the database
and other settings. PgAdmin also includes a PSQL console that you can use to
administer the database remotely.

## Best practices

This tutorial provides you with a basic look at a one-machine, single-disk
installation of PostgreSQL. In a production environment, it's a good idea to
employ strategies for high availability, scalability, archiving, backup, load
balancing, and disaster recovery. For information about disaster recovery
planning, see
[How to design a disaster recovery plan](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/designing-a-disaster-recovery-plan).

For better performance and data safety, install the database engine on the boot
disk as this tutorial showed, and then set up the  data storage on a separate
persistent disk. To learn how to add a disk for your database, see the follow-up
tutorial
[Set up a new persistent disk for PostgreSQL Data](setting-up-postgres-data-disk).

For machines that have an Internet connection, use only strong passwords and
limit access only to trusted IP ranges.

## Cleaning up

After you've finished the PostgreSQL tutorial, you can clean up the resources you created on Google Cloud so you won't be billed for them in the future. The following sections describe how to delete or turn off these resources.

### Deleting the project

The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project you created for the tutorial.

1.  In the Cloud Console, go to the [**Projects** page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects).
1.  Click the trash can icon to the right of the project name.

**Warning**: Deleting a project has the following consequences:

If you used an existing project, you'll also delete any other work you've done in the project.
You can't reuse the project ID of a deleted project. If you created a custom project ID that you plan to use in the future, you should delete the resources i
nside the project instead. This ensures that URLs that use the project ID, such as an `appspot.com` URL, remain available.

### Deleting Compute Engine VM instances

1. In the Cloud Console, go to the [**VM instances** page](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances).
1. Click the checkbox next to your `postgres-tutorial` instance.
1. Click the **Delete** button at the top of the page.

### Deleting firewall rules for the default network

1. In the Cloud Console, go to the [**Firewall rules** page](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/firewalls).
1. Click the checkbox next to the firewall rule you want to delete.
1. Click the **Delete** button at the top of the page.
