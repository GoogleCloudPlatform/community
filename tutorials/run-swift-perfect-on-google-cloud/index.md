This tutorial shows a sample [Swift][swift] app built with [Perfect][perfect]
deployed to the Google App Engine flexible environment.

Perfect is "a complete and powerful toolbox, framework, and application server
for Linux, iOS, and macOS (OS X)." It is [open source on GitHub][perfect-github].

This tutorial assumes basic familiarity with Swift programming.

## Objectives

+ Create a Swift "Hello, world" app that uses the Perfect framework.
+ Deploy the app to the Google App Engine flexible environment.

## Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud Platform, including:

+ Google App Engine flexible environment

Use the [Pricing Calculator][pricing] to generate a cost estimate based on your
projected usage.

## Before you begin

1.  Create a project in the [Google Cloud Platform Console][console].
1.  Enable billing for your project.
1.  Install the [Google Cloud SDK][cloud-sdk].

## Handling dependencies

We'll use the [Swift Package Manager][spm] to manage our app's dependencies.

1.  Create a `package.swift` file with the following contents:

        import PackageDescription

        let package = Package(
            name: "PerfectGAE",
            targets: [
                Target(name: "PerfectGAE", dependencies: [])
            ],
            dependencies: [
                .Package(url: "https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-HTTPServer.git",
        majorVersion: 2, minor: 0)
            ]
        )

## Writing the server

1.  Create a `main.swift` with the following contents:

        import Foundation
        import PerfectLib
        import PerfectHTTP
        import PerfectHTTPServer

        // Create HTTP server.
        let server = HTTPServer()
        var routes = Routes()

        // Respond to App Engine health check requests
        // TODO: see #2

        // Basic GET request
        // TODO: see #3

        // Add the routes to the server.
        server.addRoutes(routes)

        // Set a listen port of 8080
        server.serverPort = 8080

        do {
            // Launch the HTTP server.
            try server.start()
        } catch PerfectError.networkError(let err, let msg) {
            print("Network error thrown: \(err) \(msg)")
        }

1.  Create a route to handle App Engine health-check requests" (per the [custom runtime docs][custom-runtime]):

        // Respond to App Engine health check requests
        routes.add(method: .get, uri: "/_ah/health", handler: { request, response in
            print("GET - /_ah/health route handler...")
            response.setBody(string: "OK")
            response.completed()
        })

1.  Create a route to handle `GET` requests to `/hello`:

        // Basic GET request
        routes.add(method: .get, uri: "/hello", handler: { request, response in
            print("GET - /hello route handler...")
            response.setBody(string: "Hello from Swift on Google App Engine flexible environment!")
            response.completed()
        })

## Creating the `Dockerfile`

Since Swift doesn't have an officially supported App Engine runtime, we'll
create our own.

1.  Create a `Dockerfile` with the following contents:

        FROM ibmcom/swift-ubuntu:latest
        LABEL Description="Docker image for Swift + Perfect on Google App Engine flexible environment."

        # Get extra dependencies for Perfect
        RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        openssl \
        libssl-dev \
        uuid-dev

        # Expose default port for App Engine
        EXPOSE 8080

        # Copy sources
        RUN mkdir /root/PerfectGAE
        ADD main.swift /root/PerfectGAE
        ADD Package.swift /root/PerfectGAE

        # Build the app
        RUN cd /root/PerfectGAE && swift build

        # Run the app
        USER root
        CMD ["/root/PerfectGAE/.build/debug/PerfectGAE"]

## Deploying the app

1.  Create an `app.yaml` file with the following contents:

        runtime: custom
        env: flex

1.  Run the following command to deploy your app (make take several minutes):

        gcloud app deploy

1.  Run the following command to view your app, then append `/hello` to the URL:

        gcloud app browse

If all goes well, you should see "Hello from Swift on Google App Engine flexible environment!".
