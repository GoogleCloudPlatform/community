Google Earth Engine is a geospatial processing platform powered by Google Cloud that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities. Earth Engine is used for analyzing forest and water coverage, land use change, assessing the health of agricultural fields, etc.

[GeoBeam](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dataflow-geobeam) is a framework that provides a set of Apache Beam classes and utilities that make it easier to process and transform massive amounts of Geospatial data using Google Cloud Dataflow. 

This solution uses GeoBeam to ingest Raster TIFF images generated in Google Earth Engine into BigQuery. 

## Objectives

* Import a Google Earth Engine TIFF image to a GCS bucket.
* Install the python library GeoBeam.
* Run a GeoBeam job to ingest the TIFF file from GCS bucket to BigQuery.
* Use BigQuery GeoViz to verify that the TIFF image has been ingested correctly.

## Architecture

There are several components to this architecture:

* Google Earth Engine: This is where the TIFF image from Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite imagery is generated. 
* Cloud Storage Bucket: The TIFF image from Google Earth Engine is stored in a Cloud Storage Bucket        
* Cloud Dataflow: The TIFF image in GCS bucket is processed in Dataflow using GeoBeam
* BigQuery: The processed image is stored in BigQuery as rows that include BigQuery Geospatial [POINT GEOGRAPHY](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#geography_type) datatype

## Before you begin

1.  Create a Google Cloud project for this tutorial to allow for easier cleanup.
2.  Get access to Google Earth Engine API using the link: https://signup.earthengine.google.com/.
3.  Enable the BigQuery API and the Cloud Storage API in the project.
4.  Install the geobeam python library 
    ```
    pip install geobeam
    ```

### Set environment variables

Set and configure the below environment variables as required in your project
```
export PROJECT_ID=ee-geobeam-sandbox
export IMAGES_BUCKET=tmp_images_bucket_1
export GEOBEAM_BUCKET=tmp_geobeam_bucket_1
export BQ_DATASET=tmp_bq_dataset_1
export BQ_DATASET_LOCATION=us-central1
```

### Create GCS buckets

```
gsutil mb gs://${IMAGES_BUCKET}
gsutil mb gs://${GEOBEAM_BUCKET}
```

### Create BigQuery Dataset

*   Create a BigQuery dataset where you want to ingest the TIF file from GCS.
```
bq --location=${BQ_DATASET_LOCATION} mk \
--dataset \
${PROJECT_ID}:${BQ_DATASET}
```
*   Create a table in the dataset with the schema as mentioned [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dataflow-geobeam/blob/main/geobeam/examples/dem_schema.json)
```
[ { "name": "elev", "type": "INT64" }, { "name": "geom", "type": "GEOGRAPHY" } ]
```

### Create Cloud IAM Service Account

*   Create a Cloud IAM Service Account 
*   Assign permissions to the service account to BigQuery and GCS

### Download Earth Engine Image

Export the Earth Engine Image as a TIF file to the bucket created in GCS.  

Wait for a couple of minutes for the export to complete.  

```
image = ee.ImageCollection("COPERNICUS/S2").first().select(['B4', 'B3', 'B2']);
task_config = {
    'description': 'copernicus-3',    
    'scale': 30,
    'bucket': 'ee-geobeam-2',
    'fileNamePrefix': 'copernicusExport'
}
task = ee.batch.Export.image.toCloudStorage(image, **task_config)
task.start()
```

### Run GeoBeam job

Run the GeoBeam job to ingest the TIFF file from GCS bucket into BigQuery. The job takes roughly 15 minutes to complete. 

```
python -m geobeam.examples.geotiff_dem \
  --runner DataflowRunner \
  --worker_harness_container_image gcr.io/dataflow-geobeam/example-py37 \
  --experiment use_runner_v2 \
  --project lbg-sandbox \
  --temp_location gs://{bucket_to_store_geobeam_jobrun_info} \
  â€”-service_account_email {service_account_email_from_previous_step} \
  --region us-central1 \
  --gcs_url gs://{bucket_to_store_images}/copernicusExport.tif \
  --dataset {name_of_bq_dataset} \
  --table dem \
  --band_column elev \
  --max_num_workers 3 \
  --machine_type c2-standard-30 \
  --merge_blocks 80 \
  --centroid_only true
```

### Check BigQuery Viz

Check BigQuery Viz to see if the images match roughly

## Cleaning up and next steps

    gcloud functions delete Archiver
    gcloud functions delete StackDriverRelay
    gcloud pubsub subscriptions delete bulk-drainer --topic demo-data
    gcloud pubsub topics delete drain-tasks
    gcloud pubsub topics delete demo-data

You can choose to delete the notifications and alert policy in the console.
