This tutorial shows how to set up an [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) on
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in just a few minutes. Follow this tutorial to configure
Android Studio development environment on an Ubuntu or Windows server virtual machine instance on Compute Engine with the ability 
to use Android Emulators and accelerate your development.

We will set up a full fledged environment which is fast enough to do Gradle Builds in a second!
