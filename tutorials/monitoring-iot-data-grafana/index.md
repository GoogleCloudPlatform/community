In this tutorial, you set up a monitoring environment for IoT devices with an Arduino-based board (ESP32), Grafana, and Google Cloud.

## Objectives

*   Send temperature data from an ESP32 built-in sensor to a temperature topic.
*   Create a Pub/Sub queue to receive data.
*   Host a Go service, Prometheus, and a Grafana container on Cloud Run.
*   Collect temperature data, send it to Prometheus, and show it on Grafana.
*   Create a Grafana dashboard.

## Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud, including the following:

*   [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)
*   [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub)
*   [IoT Core](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/iot)

This tutorial should not generate any usage that would not be covered by the [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/), but you can use the
[pricing calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected production usage.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you're using a Unix-like operating system.

This tutorial requires an [ESP32 board](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32).

This tutorial requires the Arduino IDE, so make sure that you have it installed and set up for ESP32 usage. If you need help, you can follow 
[this tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/).

The instructions in this tutorial use the [Cloud SDK command-line interface](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) to set up the environment, but you
can use [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

## Getting started

First, take a look at the infrastructure used in this tutorial:

![architecture](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/monitoring-iot-data-grafana/architecture.png)

This tutorial uses the built-in temperature sensor of the ESP32 to send data every 5 seconds to a Pub/Sub service in Google Cloud. This data is processed
by a Go service and sent to Prometheus, and you use Grafana to visualize the data.

Grafana is a visualization tool. Prometheus is a data source for Grafana that collects the data in time series and displays it in a way that Grafana understands.

Because Prometheus can’t collect data directly from Pub/Sub, a service is used to send the data to Prometheus.

The author of this tutorial made a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/leozz37/iot-monitoring-gcp-grafana) with all of the code used in this article, which
you are welcome to use.

So, it’s time to get your hands dirty!

## Set up Google Cloud

On Google Cloud, you use IoT Core to manage your devices, Pub/Sub as a messaging system, and Cloud Run to host your containers.

### Google account

First, you need to set up your project. You need a Google account and a credit card, but don’t worry—you won’t be charged for anything (if you don’t do some 
heavy work); your free trial lasts for 3 months and you have US$300 to spend on any Google Cloud service. But you can always keep an eye on your billing report
to make sure that you don't have any surprises on your credit card.

### Environment variables

To make things easier, you can export these environment variables with your own names filled in and just paste the commands from this tutorial:

    export PROJECT_ID=
    export REGION=
    export TOPIC_ID=
    export SUBSCRIPTION=
    export REGISTRY=
    export DEVICE_ID=
    export USER_NAME=
    export IMAGE_NAME=
    export SERVICE_NAME=

For example, the first export command—which sets the environment variable for your project ID—should look something like this:

    export PROJECT_ID=temperature-grafana

### Create a project

Log in with your Google account, create a project, and select the project created:

    gcloud auth login

    gcloud projects create $PROJECT_ID

    gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

You can check your project dashboard, and if everything goes well, you should see your project there.

![Select Project](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/monitoring-iot-data-grafana/img1.png)

### Enable billing

Enable billing in your project by running the following command and confirming in the browser that billing is enabled:

    open "https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/linkedaccount?project=$PROJECT_ID"

### Enable services

Enable Pub/Sub and IoT Core services in your project: 

    gcloud services enable cloudiot.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com

### Grant publishing role for Pub/Sub

You need to permit IoT Core to publish to the Pub/Sub service. Because IoT Core is responsible for your devices, and they don’t need to subscribe to any topics,
you give them just the publishing role:

    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
        --member=serviceAccount:cloud-iot@system.gserviceaccount.com \
        --role=roles/pubsub.publisher

### Choose a region

Choose a region as described [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/).

This tutorial uses `us-central1`, but you can pick one that better suits you.

### Set up a Pub/Sub topic, subscription, and registry

On MQTT, Pub/Sub works like an Instagram or Twitter hashtag, where you can publish a post using a hashtag and whoever is following (or subscribed to)
that hashtag sees your post. MQTT works in a similar way, but the hashtag is the topic, the photo is the message, and the person following that topic is the 
subscription.

A registry is like a bucket for your IoT devices. It allows you to group devices and set properties that they all share, such as connection protocol, data 
storage location, and Pub/Sub topics.

The following commands create a topic, subscription, and registry:

    gcloud pubsub topics create $TOPIC_ID

    gcloud pubsub subscriptions create --topic $TOPIC_ID $SUBSCRIPTION

    gcloud iot registries create $REGISTRY \
        --region=$REGION \
        --event-notification-config=topic=temperature-topic \
        --enable-mqtt-config --enable-http-config

You can check your [registries](https://console.cloud.google.com/iot/registries) and, if everything goes well, you should see your registry with your topic and 
subscription there.

## Set up the ESP32 device

This tutorial uses the Espressif micro-controller ESP32 for its WiFi and built-in temperature sensor. 

### Generate a key pair for device authentication

You need to generate an elliptic curve (EC) ES256 private/public key pair for your device authentication. Make sure to store them in a safe place.

    openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out ec_private.pem

    openssl ec -in ec_private.pem -pubout -out ec_public.pem
    
### Register the device with IoT Core

    gcloud iot devices create $DEVICE_ID \
        --region=$REGION \
        --registry=$REGISTRY \
        --public-key="path=./ec_public.pem,type=es256"

### Install Arduino libraries

Install the [Google Cloud IoT Core JWT library](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-iot-arduino) and the 
[Light Weight MQTT (lwmqtt) library by Joël Gähwiler](https://github.com/256dpi/arduino-mqtt) in your Arduino IDE. These libraries are responsible for 
connecting, authenticating, and sending messages to Google Cloud.

![arduino libs](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/monitoring-iot-data-grafana/img3.png)

Use the library code example for ESP32-lwmqtt:

![arduino example](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/monitoring-iot-data-grafana/img4.png)

### Set up credentials and keys

In `ciotc_config.h`, set your WiFi network and credentials:

    // Wifi network details
    const char *ssid = "SSID";
    const char *password = "PASSWORD";// Cloud iot details
    const char *project_id = "project-id";
    const char *location = "us-central1";
    const char *registry_id = "my-registry";
    const char *device_id = "my-esp32-device";

To get your `private_key_str`, run the following command in the same directory where you saved your public/private keys and paste the private key into the code:

    openssl ec -in ec_private.pem -noout -text

The key length should be 32 pairs of hexadecimal digits. If your private key is bigger, remove the `00:` and if it's smaller add `00:`. It should look like this:

![private-key](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/monitoring-iot-data-grafana/img5.png)

You’ll need to set up your `root_cert` as well. Do the same steps as previously:

    openssl s_client -showcerts -connect mqtt.googleapis.com:8883

It should look something like this:

![root-cert](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/monitoring-iot-data-grafana/img6.png)

### Set up temperature data collection

In the `Esp32-lwmqtt.ino` file, make some changes to get the ESP32 temperature. This is what the code looks like:

    #include "esp32-mqtt.h"

    #ifdef __cplusplus
    extern "C" {
    #endif
        uint8_t temprature_sens_read();
    #ifdef __cplusplus
    }
    #endif

    uint8_t temprature_sens_read();

    void setup() {
      Serial.begin(115200);
      pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
      setupCloudIoT();
    }

    unsigned long lastMillis = 0;
    void loop() {
      mqtt->loop();
      delay(10);

      if (!mqttClient->connected()) {
        connect();
      }

  
      if (millis() - lastMillis > 5000) {
        lastMillis = millis();

        const float temperature = (temprature_sens_read() - 32) / 1.8;

        String payload =
          String("{\"temperature\":") + String(temperature) + String("}");
        publishTelemetry(payload);
      }
    }

Set up a Dockerfile:

    FROM golang

    COPY . /app
    WORKDIR /app

    ENV GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/resources/service-account-key.json

    RUN go mod download

    CMD ["go", "run", "pubsub.go"]

## Build and deploy with Cloud Build, Cloud Run, and Container Registry

Enable Cloud Build, Cloud Run, and Container Registry in your project:

    gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com containerregistry.googleapis.com

Build and push your Go service Docker image to Cloud Build:

    gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$IMAGE_NAME

    gcloud run deploy $SERVICE_NAME --image gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/ $IMAGE_NAME \
        --region us-central1 \
        --platform managed \
        --allow-authenticated \
        --port 2112

Google Cloud generates a URL for your container. Copy the URL. You can get it on your terminal or by accessing your project on the
[**Cloud Run** page](https://console.cloud.google.com/run).

![console-link](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/monitoring-iot-data-grafana/img9.png)

Paste the URL (without the `https://`) in your `prometheus.yml` file, in the `targets` section:

    global:
      scrape_interval:     10s
      evaluation_interval: 10s
      external_labels:
        monitor: 'codelab-monitor'

    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'temperature'
        scrape_interval: 5s
        static_configs:
        - targets:
          - 'temperature-grafana-utsma6q3sq-uc.a.run.app' # Your project URL

Because you can't deploy existing images from Docker Hub to Cloud Run, you need to make a custom Docker image for Prometheus and Grafana and then deploy them.

Deploy a Prometheus container:

    FROM prom/prometheus
    ADD ./prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    EXPOSE 9090

Build and submit to production:

    gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/prometheus .

    gcloud run deploy prometheus --image gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/prometheus \
        --region $REGION \
        --platform managed \
        --allow-unauthenticated \
        --port 9090

Make sure to save the URL generated. 

Do the same thing for Grafana:

    FROM grafana/grafana
    EXPOSE 3000
    ENTRYPOINT [ "/run.sh" ]

Build and submit to production:

    gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/grafana .

    gcloud run deploy grafana --image gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/grafana \
        --region $REGION \
        --platform managed \
        --allow-unauthenticated \
        --port 3000

## Use the dashboard to view data

Now you can access your Grafana dashboard through the generated URL. You can log in with the admin credentials. The default user is `admin`, and the default 
password is `admin`. Be sure to change that.

Now you have to set up Grafana to listen to Prometheus. After logging in, go to **Data Source** on the right menu bar, click **Add data source**, and select
**Prometheus**.

![grafana-data-source](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/monitoring-iot-data-grafana/img10.png)

On the Prometheus data source page, paste the URL to your Prometheus instance in the **URL** field and click **Save and test**.

![grafana-data-source](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/monitoring-iot-data-grafana/img11.png)

In the [GitHub repository accompanying this tutorial](https://github.com/leozz37/iot-monitoring-gcp-grafana/blob/master/grafana/grafana.json), there’s a JSON 
file that will import a Grafana dashboard. You can use it or create your own. If you're looking into creating your own dashboards, see the
[Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) for information about PromQL, the language used for querying metrics
data.

To import the dashboard in the sample repository, go to the right menu bar, then to **Create and Import**. Paste the JSON content into the text box and click 
**Load**.

Select **Prometheus** as your data source, and you should have a dashboard like this one:

![grafana-dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/monitoring-iot-data-grafana/img12.png)

Now plug your ESP32 into USB, and you should see the graph going up and down!

![final-gif](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/monitoring-iot-data-grafana/gif1.gif)

That’s it. You can monitor data from IoT devices anywhere in the world.

## Cleaning up

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this tutorial, you can delete the project.

To delete a project, do the following:

1.  In the Cloud Console, go to the [Projects page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects).
1.  In the project list, select the project you want to delete and click **Delete**.
1.  In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
