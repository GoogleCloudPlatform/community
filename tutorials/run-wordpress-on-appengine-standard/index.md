[WordPress][wordpress] is an open source web framework for PHP developers that encourages the use of the
model-view-controller (MVC) pattern.

This tutorial illustrates how to use a simple command-line tool for downloading
and configuring WordPress on App Engine standard environment for PHP 7.2.

You can check out [PHP on Google Cloud][php-gcp] to get an
overview of PHP and learn ways to run PHP apps on Google Cloud.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a project in the [Cloud Console][cloud-console].
1. Enable billing for your project.
1. Install the [Cloud SDK][cloud_sdk].
1. [Enable the Cloud SQL API][cloud-sql-api-enable].
1. Install [Composer][composer].

### Create and configure a Cloud SQL for MySQL instance

**Note**: In this guide, we use `wordpress` for the instance name and the database
name. We use `root` for the database user name.

1.  Create a new Cloud SQL for MySQL Second Generation instance with the following
    command:

        $ gcloud sql instances create wordpress \
            --activation-policy=ALWAYS \
            --tier=db-n1-standard-1 \
            --region=us-central1

    **Note**: you can choose `db-f1-micro` or `db-g1-small` instead of
    `db-n1-standard-1` for the Cloud SQL machine type, especially for
    development or testing purposes. However, those machine types are not
    recommended for production use and are not eligible for Cloud SQL SLA
    coverage. See the [Cloud SQL SLA](https://cloud.google.com/sql/sla)
    for more details.

1.  Create the database you want your WordPress site to use:

        $ gcloud sql databases create wordpress --instance wordpress

1.  Change the root password for your instance:

        $ gcloud sql users set-password root \
            --host=% \
            --instance wordpress \
            --password=YOUR_INSTANCE_ROOT_PASSWORD # Don't use this password!

## Create or update a WordPress project for App Engine

The `wp-gae` command provides a convenient way for you to either create
a new WordPress project or add the required configuration to an existing one.

### Setup

1.  Download the `google/cloud-tools` package:

        $ composer require google/cloud-tools

    **Note**: If you receive an error about extensions, install `phar` and `zip` PHP
    extensions and retry:
    
        $ sudo apt-get install php7.2-zip php7.2-curl

1.  Now you can run the `wp-gae` command which is included in that package:

        $ php vendor/bin/wp-gae

    **Note**: You can also install `google/cloud-tools` [globally][composer-global],
    which will allow you to execute the command `wp-gae` anywhere.

The `wp-gae` command will ask you several question in order to set up your Cloud SQL
database connection, and then write the required configuration to your `wp-config.php`
configuration file. It also copies the following files into your project directory
to allow WordPress to run on App Engine:

 - [`app.yaml`][app_yaml]: The App Engine configuration file that specifies the runtime and static asset handlers.
 - [`cron.yaml`][cron_yaml]: The App Engine configuration file that ensures `wp-cron.php` is run every 15 minutes.
 - [`php.ini`][php_ini]: For setting PHP configuration in App Engine specific to WordPress.
 - [`gae-app.php`][gae_app_php]: The Front Controller, which is required for all App Engine applications.

### Create a new WordPress project

To download WordPress and set it up for GCP, run the `create` command:

    $ php vendor/bin/wp-gae create

The command asks you several questions. After you answer them, you'll have a
new WordPress project. By default, it will create `my-wordpress-project` in the
current directory.

**Note**: To determine the region your database is in, use the
`gcloud sql instances describe wordpress` command.

    $ gcloud sql instances describe wordpress | grep region


### Update an existing WordPress project

If you are migrating an existing project to Google Cloud, you can use the
`update` command:

    $ php vendor/bin/wp-gae update path/to/your-wordpress-site

The command asks you several questions. After you answer them, your existing
project will contain the required files for deploying to App Engine, as well
as an updated `wp-config.php` file. As this command overwrites `wp-config.php`,
be sure to verify the changes are correct before deploying.

## Deploy to Google Cloud

`cd` into the root of your WordPress project:

    $ cd my-wordpress-project

Run the following command to deploy your project to App Engine:

    $ gcloud app deploy app.yaml cron.yaml

Now you can access your site, and continue the installation step! The URL is
`https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com/`.

**NOTE**: If you receive any error in your application, such as "Error estabilishing
a database connection", set the `WP_DEBUG` constant to `true` in `wp-config.php` and
redeploy:

    define('WP_DEBUG', true);

### Enable the Google Cloud Storage plugin

To use the [Google Cloud Storage plugin][gcs-plugin] for media uploads, follow
these steps:

1.  Configure the App Engine default Cloud Storage bucket for later use. The default App
    Engine bucket is named YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com. Change the default Access
    Control List (ACL) of that bucket as follows:

        $ gsutil defacl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

1.  Go to the Dashboard at `https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com/wp-admin`. On the
    Plugins page, activate the `Google Cloud Storage plugin`.
1.  In the plugins Settings page, set your Bucket name to the bucket you
    configured in Step 1.

After activating the plugin, try uploading a media object in a new post
and confirm the image is uploaded to the Cloud Storage bucket by visiting the
[Cloud Console Storage page][cloud-storage-console].

## Local development

To access this MySQL instance, use Cloud SQL Proxy. [Download][cloud-sql-proxy-download]
it to your local computer and make it executable.

To install in Cloud Shell:

    $ wget https://dl.google.com/cloudsql/cloud_sql_proxy.linux.amd64 -O cloud_sql_proxy
    $ chmod +x cloud_sql_proxy

Go to the [the Credentials section][credentials-section] of your project in the
Console. Click **Create credentials** and then click **Service account key**. For
the Service account, select **App Engine app default service account**. Then
click **Create** to create and download the JSON service account key to your
local machine. Save it to a safe place.

Run the proxy by the following command:

    $ ./cloud_sql_proxy \
        -instances=YOUR_PROJECT_ID:us-central1:wordpress=tcp:3306 \
        -credential_file=/path/to/YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_FILE.json &
        
If running within Cloud Shell:

    $ ./cloud_sql_proxy -instances <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>:us-central1:wordpress=tcp:3306 &

**Note**: See [Connecting to Cloud SQL from External Applications][cloud-sql-external-apps]
for more options when running the Cloud SQL proxy.

Now you can access the Cloud SQL instance with the MySQL client in a separate
command-line tab.

    $ mysql --host=127.0.0.1 -u root -p
    mysql> use database wordpress;
    mysql> show tables;
    mysql> exit

## Various workflows

### Install and update WordPress, plugins, and themes

Because the `wp-content` directory on the server is read-only, you have
to perform all code updates locally. Run WordPress locally and update the
plugins and themes in the local Dashboard, deploy the code to production, then
activate them in the production Dashboard. You can also use the `wp-cli` utility
as follows. Be sure to keep the Cloud SQL proxy running.

    # Install the wp-cli utility
    $ composer require wp-cli/wp-cli-bundle
    # Now you can run the "wp" command to update Wordpress itself
    $ vendor/bin/wp core update --path=wordpress
    # You can also update all the plugins and themes
    $ vendor/bin/wp plugin update --all
    $ vendor/bin/wp theme update --all

The following error may occur:

    Failed opening required 'google/appengine/api/urlfetch_service_pb.php'

If you get this error, you can set a `WP_CLI_PHP_ARGS` environment variable to add
`include_path` PHP configuration for wp-cli:

    $ export WP_CLI_PHP_ARGS='-d include_path=vendor/google/appengine-php-sdk'

Then try the update commands again.

After everything is up to date, deploy the app again:

    $ gcloud app deploy app.yaml cron.yaml
    
**Note**: This will deploy a new version of the app and set it as the default while keeping the previous versions available
under versioned hostnames. Visit the App Engine, Versions area to see previous versions.

Alternately, you may deploy the new version and stop previous ones so they stop incurring charges:

    $ gcloud app deploy app.yaml cron.yaml --promote --stop-previous-versions

### Remove plugins and themes

To remove plugins and themes, first deactivate them in the production Dashboard, and then
remove them completely locally. The next deployment will remove those files from
the production environment.
