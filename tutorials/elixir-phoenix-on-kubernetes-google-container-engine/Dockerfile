# This is a sample Dockerfile for packaging an Elixir Phoenix application
# as a Docker image. It builds a Distillery release and installs it on
# Alpine Linux. The final image launches the application on port 8080. It
# requires the project ID to be passed in the project_id build arg.
#
# This Dockerfile includes two stages and requires Docker 17.05 or later.
#
# To adapt this Dockerfile to your app, you may need to customize the app_name
# and phoenix_subdir build arguments, as outlined below.


################################################################################
# BUILD STAGE
#
# Builds the app, does a Brunch build to build the assets, and creates a
# release. This stage uses the official Alpine Linux - Elixir base image, and
# installs a few additional build tools such as Node.js.

FROM elixir:alpine

## Build arguments. Modify these to adapt this Dockerfile to your app.      ##
## Alternatively, you may specify --build-arg when running `docker build`.  ##

## The name of your Phoenix application.                                    ##
ARG app_name=hello

## The subdirectory of the Phoenix application within the toplevel project. ##
## If your project is an umbrella project, this should be the relative path ##
## to the Phoenix application, e.g. "apps/hello_web". If this is a simple   ##
## project, this should be "."                                              ##
ARG phoenix_subdir=.

## End build arguments.                                                     ##
