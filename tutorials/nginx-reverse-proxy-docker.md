This tutorial will guide you through running multiple websites on a Google Compute
Engine instance using Docker. You will secure the websites using free SSL/TLS
certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

## Objectives

- Create a Compute Engine instance.
- Run an NGINX reverse proxy.
- Run multiple web applications in Docker.
- Install SSL/TLS certificates with Let's Encrypt.

## Before you begin

1.  Create or select a Cloud Platform project from the [Google Cloud Platform
    console's projects page](https://console.cloud.google.com/project).
1.  [Enable
    billing](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499#enable-billing)
    for your project.

## Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Cloud Platform including

- [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing)

Use the [Pricing
Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/#id=bb109d69-241c-4262-afdf-a6604401e053)
to estimate the costs for your usage.

## Setting up the virtual machine

Create a new Compute Engine instance using the [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/why)
stable image. CoreOS comes with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)
pre-installed and supports automatic system updates.

1.  Open the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
1.  [Create a new Compute Engine instance](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instancesAdd).
1.  Select the desired **Zone**, such as "us-central1-f".
1.  Select the desired **Machine type**, such as "micro" (f1-micro).
1.  Change the **Boot disk** to "CoreOS stable".
1.  Check the boxes to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic in the **Firewall** section.
1.  Expand the **Management, disk, networking** section.
1.  Click the **Networking** tab.
1.  Select **New static IP address** under **External IP**.
1.  Give the IP address a name, such as "reverse-proxy".
1.  Click the **Create** button to create the Compute Engine instance.

## Set up some domains for your instance

Create multiple [A type DNS
records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types) for various
domains/subdomains on your DNS provider pointing at the external IP address for
your new instance.

For example, in [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/registrar), open
**DNS** for your domain, scroll to [Custom resource
records](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3251147) and add an **A**
type record. The name "@" corresponds to the root of your domain or you can
change it to a subdomain, such as "a" and "b".

This tutorial will assume you have two subdomains with A records:

- a.example.com
- b.example.com

## Setting up the reverse proxy

To have the separate websites respond only to their respective hosts, you'll
use a [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy). This
tutorial uses the [nginx-proxy Docker
container](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) to automatically configure
NGINX to forward requests to the corresponding website.

As an example, this tutorial will show a plain NGINX server running as
site A and a [plain Apache server](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd/) running as site B.

1.  Run the reverse proxy.

        docker run -d \
            --name nginx-proxy \
            -p 80:80 \
            -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro jwilder/nginx-proxy

1.  Start the container for site A, specifying the domain name in the
    `VIRTUAL_HOST` variable.

        docker run -d --name site-a -e VIRTUAL_HOST=a.example.com nginx

1.  Check out your website at http://a.example.com.
1.  With site A still running, start the container for site B.

        docker run -d --name site-b -e VIRTUAL_HOST=b.example.com httpd

1.  Check out site B at http://b.example.com.

Congratulations, you are running multiple apps on the same host using
Docker and an [nginx reverse proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy).

**Note:** If you do not wish to set up HTTPS for your websites using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), you can skip reading the rest of this tutorial.

## Setting up HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

Plain HTTP is not secure. It is not encrypted and is vulnerable to
[man-in-the-middle
attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack). In this step,
you'll add support for the HTTPS protocol.

1.  Stop the containers.

        docker stop site-a
        docker stop site-b
        docker stop nginx-proxy

1.  Remove the containers.

        docker rm site-a
        docker rm site-b
        docker rm nginx-proxy

To enable HTTPS via
[TLS/SSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), your reverse
proxy requires cryptographic certificates. Use [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) via the [Docker Let's Encrypt nginx-proxy
companion](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion) to
automatically issue and use signed certificates.

1.  Create a directory to hold the certificates.

        cd
        mkdir certs

1.  Run the proxy, but this time declaring volumes so that the 
    [Let's Encrypt
    companion](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion)
    can populate them with certificates.

        docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
            --name nginx-proxy \
            -v $HOME/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:ro \
            -v /etc/nginx/vhost.d \
            -v /usr/share/nginx/html \
            -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro \
            --label com.github.jrcs.letsencrypt_nginx_proxy_companion.nginx_proxy=true \
            jwilder/nginx-proxy

1.  Run the Let's Encrypt companion container.

        docker run -d \
            --name nginx-letsencrypt \
            --volumes-from nginx-proxy \
            -v $HOME/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:rw \
            -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
            jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion

1.  Run site A.

    In addition to `VIRTUAL_HOST`, specify `LETSENCRYPT_HOST` to declare the
    host name to use for the HTTPS certificate. Specify the `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL`
    so that [Let's Encrypt can email you about certificate
    expirations](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/expiration-emails/).

        docker run -d \
            --name site-a \
            -e 'LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=webmaster@example.com' \
            -e 'LETSENCRYPT_HOST=a.example.com' \
            -e 'VIRTUAL_HOST=a.example.com' nginx

1.  You can watch the companion creator request new certificates by watching the logs.

        docker logs nginx-letsencrypt

    You should eventually see a log which says `Saving cert.pem`.

1.  After the certificate is issued, check out your website at
    https://a.example.com.

1.  Run site B.

        docker run -d \
            --name site-b \
            -e 'LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=webmaster@example.com' \
            -e 'LETSENCRYPT_HOST=b.example.com' \
            -e 'VIRTUAL_HOST=b.example.com' httpd

1.  You can watch the companion creator request new certificates by watching the logs.

        docker logs nginx-letsencrypt

    You should eventually see a log which says `Saving cert.pem`.

1.  After the certificate is issued, check out your website at
    https://b.example.com.

Congratulations, your web apps are now running behind an HTTPS reverse proxy.

## Proxying composed web apps

In order to proxy the `nginx-proxy` container and the web app container must be on
the same [Docker network](https://runnable.com/docker/basic-docker-networking).

When you run a multi-container web app with `docker-compose`, [Docker attaches the
containers to a default network](https://runnable.com/docker/docker-compose-networking).
The default network is different from the bridge network that containers run with
the `docker run` command attach to.

If you run the `docker-compose` and have specified a `VIRTUAL_HOST`
environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` configuration file,
you'll see this error message in the `docker logs nginx-proxy` output:

     no servers are inside upstream

The proxy will also stop working. To resolve this,

1.  Create a new Docker network.

        docker network create --driver bridge reverse-proxy
 
1.  Stop and remove your web application containers, the `nginx-proxy` container,
    and the `nginx-letsencrypt` container.
    
        docker stop my-container
        docker rm my-container
        docker stop nginx-proxy
        docker rm nginx-proxy
        docker stop nginx-letsencrypt
        docker rm nginx-letsencrypt

1.  Run the proxy and other containers, specifying the network with the
    `--net reverse-proxy` command-line parameter.
    
    Run the proxy container.
    
        docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
            --name nginx-proxy \
            --net reverse-proxy \
            -v $HOME/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:ro \
            -v /etc/nginx/vhost.d \
            -v /usr/share/nginx/html \
            -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro \
            --label com.github.jrcs.letsencrypt_nginx_proxy_companion.nginx_proxy=true \
            jwilder/nginx-proxy

    Run the Let's Encrypt helper container.
    
        docker run -d \
            --name nginx-letsencrypt \
            --net reverse-proxy \
            --volumes-from nginx-proxy \
            -v $HOME/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:rw \
            -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
            jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion

    Run your website containers.
    
        docker run -d \
            --name site-a \
            --net reverse-proxy \
            -e 'LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=webmaster@example.com' \
            -e 'LETSENCRYPT_HOST=a.example.com' \
            -e 'VIRTUAL_HOST=a.example.com' nginx

1.  Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to include the network you created
    in the networks definition.

        networks:
          reverse-proxy:
            external:
              name: reverse-proxy
          back:
            driver: bridge

    In the container definitions, specify the appropriate networks. Only
    the web server needs to be on the reverse-proxy network. The other
    containers can stay on their own network.
    
    The final `docker-compose.yml` file will look something like this:
    
    ```yml
    version: '2'
    services:

      db:
        restart: always
        image: my_database
        networks:
          - back

      web:
        restart: always
        image: my_webserver
        networks:
          - reverse-proxy
          - back
        environment:
          - VIRTUAL_PORT=1234
          - VIRTUAL_HOST=c.example.com
          - LETSENCRYPT_HOST=c.example.com
          - LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=webmaster@example.com
    
    networks:
      reverse-proxy:
        external:
          name: reverse-proxy
      back:
        driver: bridge
    ```

1.  Run the `docker-compose up -d` command to run your composed containers
    with the new configuration.

## Surviving reboots

When your Compute Engine instance restarts, the Docker containers will not
automatically restart. Use the `--restart` flag for the `docker run` command to
specify a [Docker restart
policy](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#restart-policies---restart).
I suggest `always` or `unless-stopped` so that Docker restarts the containers
on reboot.

## Next steps

Running many web apps on a single host behind a reverse proxy is an efficient
way to run hobby applications. To make your experience even better,

- [Set up the Google Cloud logging driver for Docker to upload your containers'
  logs to Stackdriver
  Logging](/community/tutorials/docker-gcplogs-driver).

Note that apps deployed to a single instance are not highly available. For
example, your applications will not be available during a system reboot.

To see how to run an app which requires high availability or scaling to many
queries per second, try out some more scalable ways of hosting.

1.  Deploy a scalable web app using [App Engine flexible
    environment](/appengine/docs/flexible/python/quickstart).
1.  Host a [static website using Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart).
1.  Host a [static website using Cloud Storage](/storage/docs/hosting-static-website).
