This tutorial explains how to monitor a [Ghost blog][ghost] deployed on
[Google App Engine Flexible Environment][flex].

## Objectives

* Understand Stackdriver Monitoring with Ghost.
* Understand Stackdriver Logging with Ghost.
* Activate Stackdriver Trace.

## Before you begin

Complete the tutorial [Ghost on App Engine Part 1 - Deploying][deploying].

## Understanding Stackdriver Monitoring

Monitoring is powered by [Stackdriver Monitoring][monitoring].

You don't have to install the monitoring agent on Google App Engine Flexible
Environment because Stackdriver monitoring support is built-in.

You can [view the monitoring dashboard][mon_dash] for your Ghost blog in the
Google Stackdriver Console.

[monitoring]: https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/
[mon_dash]: https://app.google.stackdriver.com/services/app-engine/

## Understanding Stackdriver Logging

Logging is powered by [Stackdriver Logging][logging].

You don't have to install the logging agent on Google App Engine Flexible
Environment because Stackdriver Logging support is built-in. See
[Stackdriver Logging in App Engine Apps for more information][logging].

You can [view the logs][logs] for your Ghost blog in the Google Cloud Platform
Console.

[logging]: https://cloud.google.com/logging/
[gae_logging]: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/articles/logging
[logs]: https://console.cloud.google.com/logs?service=appengine.googleapis.com

## Using Stackdriver Trace

Tracing of HTTP requests and RPC calls in your Ghost blog is powered by
[Stackdriver Trace][trace].

To begin tracing what goes on in your Ghost blog you must import the
[Node.js trace agent][trace_agent] into the application.

[trace]: https://cloud.google.com/trace/
[trace_agent]: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-trace-nodejs

### Enable Trace

1. To install the `@google/cloud-trace` module during deployment, edit the
`package.json` file and add a `postinstall` script:

        "scripts": {
          "preinstall": "...",
          "postinstall": "npm install @google/cloud-trace",
          "start": "...",
          "test": "..."
        }

    We use a `postinstall` script because it allows us to avoid messing with
    Ghost's `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file.

1. Create a `trace.js` file with the following contents:

        if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
          require('@google/cloud-trace').start({
            enhancedDatabaseReporting: true
          });
        }

1. To start Stackdriver Trace when the deployed application starts, the
`@google/cloud-trace` module must be imported as the very first thing the
application does. Add the following to the _very first line_ of `index.js`:

        require('./trace');

    The application will now use Stackdriver Trace when it is deployed to App
    Engine.

1. Re-deploy the application:

        gcloud app deploy

1. After a few minutes, activity in your application causes traces to appear in
the [Trace Dashboard][trace_dashboard].

[trace_dashboard]: https://console.cloud.google.com/traces/traces

## Error Reporting

Error reporting in your Ghost blog is powered by [Stackdriver Error Reporting][errorreporting].

Error reporting works by capturing logs written to a certain location. We will
use the [winston][winston] library to write the logs to the right location.

[winston]: https://github.com/winstonjs/winston

### Enable Error Reporting

1. To install the `winston` module during deployment, edit the `package.json`
file and add `winston` to the `postinstall` script you added earlier:

        "scripts": {
          "preinstall": "...",
          "postinstall": "npm install @google/cloud-trace winston",
          "start": "...",
          "test": "..."
        }

1. Create an `errorreporting.js` file with the following contents:

        var logFile = '/var/log/app_engine/custom_logs/ghost.errors.log.json';
        var winston = require('winston');

        winston.add(winston.transports.File, {
          filename: logFile
        });

        function report (err, req) {
          var payload = {
            serviceContext: {
              service: 'ghost'
            },
            message: err ? err.stack : '',
            context: {
              httpRequest: {
                url: req.originalUrl,
                method: req.method,
                referrer: req.header('Referer'),
                userAgent: req.header('User-Agent'),
                remoteIp: req.ip,
                responseStatusCode: 500
              }
            }
          };
          winston.error(payload);
        }

        function skip (req, res) {
          if (res.statusCode >= 400) {
            report(null, req);
          }
          return false
        }

        exports.logging = {
          skip: skip
        };

1. To start collecting errors when the deployed application starts, the error
reporting code needs to be added to the Express application. Add the following
`logging` setting to `config.json`:

        production: {
          // Other settings hidden

          logging: require('./errorreporting').logging
        }

1. Re-deploy the application:

        gcloud app deploy

1. Any request errors will now be reported in the [Error Reporting Dashboard][error_dashboard].

[errorreporting]: https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting/
[error_dashboard]: https://console.cloud.google.com/errors

## Debugging

Debugging your Ghost blog is powered by [Stackdriver Debugger][debugger].

To make Stackdriver Debugger available to your Ghost blog you must import the
[Node.js debugger agent][debugger_agent] into the application.

### Enable Debugger

1. To install the `@google/cloud-debug` module during deployment, edit the
`package.json` file and add `@google/cloud-debug` to the `postinstall` script
you added earlier:

        "scripts": {
          "preinstall": "...",
          "postinstall": "npm install @google/cloud-trace winston @google/cloud-debug",
          "start": "...",
          "test": "..."
        }

1. Create a `debug.js` file with the following contents:

        if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
          require('@google/cloud-debug').start();
        }

1. To make Stackdriver Debugger available to the deployed application, the
`@google/cloud-debug` module must be imported as the second thing the
application does (right after where Trace is imported). Add the following to the
top of `index.js` after `require('./trace');`:

        require('./debug');

    The application will now be able to use Stackdriver Debugger when it is
    deployed to App Engine.

1. Re-deploy the application:

        gcloud app deploy

1. You can debug the application using the [Stackdriver Debugger Dashboard][debugger_dashboard].
