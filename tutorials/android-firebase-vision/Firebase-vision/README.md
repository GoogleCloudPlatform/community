==============================

Introduction

This example shows you how to access the Cloud Vision API from Android apps
using Firebase.

- [Read more about Cloud Storage for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage)
- [Read more about Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions)
- [Read more about the Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)

Getting Started
---------------
- [Add Firebase to your Android Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).
The package name you'll use is `com.google.firebase.quickstart.firebasestorage`.
- Run the Android application on your Android device or emulator. The app prompts you to
sign in, so make sure to [enable anonymous authentication](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers)
for your project.
- Deploy the Cloud function in the `functions` directory by calling `firebase init`
`firebase deploy`
- Enable the Vision API and Firestore API for your Firebase project from the
[Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
