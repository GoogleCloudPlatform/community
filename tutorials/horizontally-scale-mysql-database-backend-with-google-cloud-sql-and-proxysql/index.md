This tutorial explains how to horizontally scale the MySQL database backend of
your application using [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql) and
[ProxySQL](http://proxysql.com).

Google Cloud SQL is a fully-managed database service that makes it easy to set
up, maintain, manage, and administer your relational PostgreSQL and MySQL
databases in the cloud. Cloud SQL offers high performance, scalability, and
convenience. Hosted on Google Cloud Platform, Cloud SQL provides a database
infrastructure for applications running anywhere.

ProxySQL is an open-source, high-performance MySQL proxy capable of routing
database queries in a MySQL database cluster. ProxySQL, with proper
configuration, allows you to dynamically scale MySQL database backend without
modifying application logic.

Note: This tutorial assumes that you have set up an application, such as a
Django/flask app or a WordPress blog, using a MySQL database as database
backend. The application itself does not need to run on Google Cloud Platform,
though deploying both your application and the database backend in the same
region of Google Cloud Platform may greatly improve performance. For options of
running your application on Google Cloud Platform, see
[Cloud Compute Products](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute/).

## Concepts

### Horizontal Scaling of Database Backend

For a small scale application, it is usually fine to deploy its database backend
on a single server, sometimes even the same server running the application
itself. However, as the number of users continues to grow, developers often find
it increasingly difficult to accommodate all the requests efficiently with one
machine, for either practical or economical reasons. Consequently, instead of
deploying the database backend on one powerful instance, an application of
larger scale often use a cluster of less capable machines together to run the
database backend, which is known as horizontal scaling of database backend.
There are many advantages in scaling your database backend horizontally. It
allows you to dynamically resize the database backend, so you may add or remove
computational capacity as you see fit without having to take the application
offline. It also largely removes the limit to how many resources you can
allocate to your database backend, and saves the work of configuring the
database management system to utilize additional resources. This is not saying
that horizontal scaling is a perfect solution though; many challenges, such as
keeping the data synchronized, protecting data integrity and making the database
backend highly available, still exist and require special attention when you
are scaling your database backend horizontally. Common approaches for
horizontally scaling include sharding and master/slave replication. In this
tutorial you will implement a database backend with master/slave replication
only, though it is also possible to shard with Cloud SQL and ProxySQL.

### Sharding

Sharding makes horizontal scaling possible by partitioning the database into
smaller, more manageable parts (shards), then deploying the parts across a
cluster of machines. Data queries are routed to the corresponding server
automatically, usually with rules embedded in application logic or a query
router.

### Master/Slave Replication

Master/Slave Replication is another common approach for scaling horizontally. In
this scheme, a database server cluster consists of one master instance and a
group of slave instances. Both types store the same set of data and accept read
requests, however, only the master instance is capable of handling write
operations. Any change to the data is directed to the master instance and later
propagated to the slave instances under the supervision of the master instance.

![MS_replication](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/horizontally-scale-mysql-database-backend-with-google-cloud-sql-and-proxysql/ms_replication.png)

## Understanding the Architecture

This tutorial uses Cloud SQL and ProxySQL to build a scalable database backend
with master/slave replication. Properly configured, this architecture should
greatly improve the performance of your database backend, especially in terms of
read operations.

At a basic level, the architecture of the project looks as follows:

![Architecture](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/horizontally-scale-mysql-database-backend-with-google-cloud-sql-and-proxysql/architecture.png)

In this project, Cloud SQL hosts the database backend of your application, which
consists of one master instance and two read replicas (slave instances). You may
add or remove replicas dynamically at any time. Your application receives
requests from the Internet as usual and sends read/write requests to ProxySQL as
if ProxySQL is one single database server; ProxySQL stores a list of rules for
routing queries and distributes the queries to the master instance and the read
replicas accordingly. After the Cloud SQL instances complete the queries, the
results are returned to the application via ProxySQL. All the updates are
applied on the master instance and replicated to the read replicas
automatically.

Note: In this tutorial ProxySQL runs in the same server as the application; for
best performance, you may want to run ProxySQL on a separate machine.

### Limitations

This tutorial assumes that your application is read-intensive, and it is OK that
some of your users may not be able to see the latest update immediately (as it
takes time to propagate changes from the master to slaves). However, if your
application writes data much more frequently than it reads data, or it is
critical that every user of your application should be able to see the latest
changes as soon as they are available, this architecture may not be optimal.

## Setting up a Cloud SQL for MySQL Instance

Note: The following steps use [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql)
to create a Cloud SQL for MySQL instance. You can also create an instance
[via Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/sql/instances/create)
or using the [Cloud SQL API](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api/v1beta4/).

1.  Go to the [Cloud SQL Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/)
		of Cloud Console. Click **Create Instance**.
1.  Choose `MySQL` as the database engine and `Second Generation` as the
		instance type.
1.  Enter an instance ID and set the root password.
1.  Choose the [location of your Cloud SQL instance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/).
		The values set here determine where your data is stored. Though you may
		deploy the instance at any location you like, generally speaking it is best
		to pick a location as close as possible to where your application runs. For
		example, if your application is also running on Google Cloud Platform, it is
		recommended that you deploy the Cloud SQL instance in the same region and
		zone as your application.

		By default Cloud SQL creates an instance using one CPU core, 3.75GB memory,
		and 10GB SSD storage. Depending on the scale of your database backend, you
		may need to use a more powerful machine type and further increase the
		storage capacity. Click **Show configuration options** to update those
		settings. It is also possible to upgrade (or downgrade) after deployment.

1.  Click **Create**.

### Data Migration

See [Importing Data into Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/import-export/importing)
for instructions on migrating data from external sources to Cloud SQL.

## Installing ProxySQL

Download the ProxySQL package for your environment
[here](https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/releases/latest) and use your system's
package manager to install it. For example, if you are running your application
on a [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) instance with Debian 9,
follow the steps below:

1.  [Connect to your Compute Engine instance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance).
		The following steps should be executed on your Compute Engine instance.
1.  Download the package:

				wget https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/releases/download/v1.4.4/proxysql_1.4.4-debian9_amd64.deb

1.  Install the package:

				dpkg -i proxysql_1.4.4-debian9_amd64.deb

1.  Start ProxySQL:

				sudo service proxysql start

1.  Check the version of ProxySQL:

				proxysql --version

		You should see a line of output similar to this:

				ProxySQL version 1.4.4-139-ga51b040, codename Truls

## Configuring ProxySQL to connect to Cloud SQL

### Network Authorization

Before using ProxySQL to connect to the Cloud SQL instance you just created, you
have to authorize the network your application resides in with Cloud SQL:

1.  Find the IP address of the system running your application. If you are using
		Compute Engine, the external IP address of your instance is listed in the
		[VM Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) of
		Cloud Console. For applications running on other Cloud platforms, refer to
		their documentation for instructions. Alternatively, you can use third-party
		websites, such as [ifconfig.me](http://ifconfig.me/), to get the IP address
		of your application server:

				curl ifconfig.me

1.  Go to the [Cloud SQL Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances)
		in the Cloud Console. Click the ID of the instance you just created.
1.  In the Instance Details page, select the **Authorization** tab. Under
		**Authorized Networks**, click **Add network**.
1.  Enter the name of the new authorized network (optional) and the IP address
		of your application server.
1.  Click **Done**. Then click **Save** to save the changes.

## Adding the Cloud SQL instance to ProxySQL

ProxySQL provides a MySQL-compatible interface for configurations. After
successfully installing ProxySQL on your system, log into the admin interface
with:

		mysql -u admin -padmin -h 127.0.0.1 -P6032 --prompt='proxysql> '

You should see the `proxysql>`  prompt after running the command.

Follow the steps below to add your Cloud SQL instance as a backend MySQL server
in ProxySQL:

1.  Go to the [Cloud SQL Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances)
		and click the ID of the instance you created. In the Instance Details page,
		write down the IPv4 address listed under **Connect to this instance**.
1.  In the ProxySQL admin interface, run the SQL query:

				INSERT INTO mysql_servers (hostname) VALUES ('[IP_ADDRESS]');

		Replace `[IP_ADDRESS]` with the IPv4 address of your Cloud SQL instance.

1.  Changes made via ProxySQL admin interface are stored in an in-memory
		database and do not take effect automatically. Run the commands below to
		bring the new changes into effect and save them to the disk:

				LOAD MYSQL SERVERS TO RUNTIME;
				SAVE MYSQL SERVERS TO DISK;

1.  Add the user credentials for connecting with this SQL query:

				INSERT INTO mysql_users(username, password) VALUES (‘[USERNAME]’,’[PASSWORD]’);

		Replace `[USERNAME]` and `[PASSWORD]` with the username and password of your
		Cloud SQL instance respectively. You may use the default user `root` and the
		root password you set when creating the Cloud SQL instance. For better
		security, create a new user with proper privileges and hostname
		restrictions. See [Creating and Managing MySQL Users](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-manage-users)
		and [MySQL Users](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/users) for more
		information.

1.  Similarly, load the new user into runtime and save it to disk:

				LOAD MYSQL USERS TO RUNTIME;
				SAVE MYSQL USERS TO DISK;

## Setting up Monitoring

ProxySQL periodically checks all the configured MySQL servers. To set up
monitoring, [create a new user in your Cloud SQL instance](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-manage-users)
and update the settings in ProxySQL admin interface:

		SET mysql-monitor_username = '[USERNAME]';
		SET mysql-monitor_password = '[PASSWORD]';

Replace `[USERNAME]` and `[PASSWORD]` with the values of your own.

If you would like to disable monitoring, run the following command in ProxySQL
admin interface:

		SET mysql-monitor_enabled = 'false';

After making changes, save the settings with:

		LOAD MYSQL VARIABLES TO RUNTIME;
		SAVE MYSQL VARIABLES TO DISK;

See [ProxySQL documentation](https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/wiki/Monitor-Module)
for more information on monitoring.

## Configuring Your Application to Use ProxySQL

In this tutorial, ProxySQL is installed in the same server as your application
and accepts connection at `127.0.0.1`, port `6033`. Update the database
configuration of your application accordingly to start using ProxySQL as a query
router. Currently, since there is only one database server listed in ProxySQL,
all the queries are routed there.

## Creating Read Replicas

Note: The following steps use [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql)
to create a Cloud SQL read replica. You can also create a read replica
[via Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/sql/instances/create)
or [using the Cloud SQL API](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api/v1beta4/).

1.  Go to the [Cloud SQL Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances)
		in the Cloud Console. Click the ID of the instance you just created. Select
		the **Replicas** tab.
1.  Click **Create read replica**. Enter an Instance ID and pick a location for
		the replica. If you would like to, click **Show configuration options** to
		give the replica a different machine type and storage solution from the
		master instance. Settings such as authorized networks are inherited from the
		master instance, though you can still change them specifically for the read
		replica.
1.  Click **Create**. It may take a while to create the instance and replicate
		the data.
1.  After the read replica comes online, click its name and write down the
		**IPv4 address** in the **Connect to this instance** card of its Instance
		Details page.
1.  Repeat the steps once to create another read replica. Write down its IPv4
		address as well.

See [Creating Read Replicas](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/replication/create-replica)
and [Requirements and Tips for Configuring Replication](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/replication/tips#read-replica)
for more information about Cloud SQL read replicas.

## Configuring ProxySQL to Distribute Database Queries

### Adding Read Replicas

In the ProxySQL admin interface, run the following SQL queries:

		INSERT INTO mysql_servers (hostgroup_id, hostname) VALUES ('1', '[IP_ADDRESS_#1]'), ('1', '[IP_ADDRESS_#2]')
		LOAD MYSQL SERVERS TO RUNTIME
		SAVE MYSQL SERVERS TO DISK

Replace `[IP_ADDRESS_#1]` and `[IP_ADDRESS_#2]` with the IPv4 addresses of the
two read replicas you just created. Note that the replicas are assigned to a
different group (`1`) from the master instance (`0`).

### Updating Rules for Distribution

Note: The steps below set a simple list of rules that distribute all write
traffic and 20% read traffic to the master instance, 40% read traffic to the
first read replica and another 40% read traffic to the second read replica. It
is based on [the sample rules in ProxySQL wiki](https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/wiki/ProxySQL-Read-Write-Split-(HOWTO)#basic-readwrite-split-using-regex).
**Those rules are for demonstration purposes only and may not suit the
performance requirements of your particular application.** Allocate different
weights to read replicas as you experiment with other query routing
functionalities [(regex, digest, etc.)](https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/wiki/ProxySQL-Read-Write-Split-(HOWTO)#readwrite-split-using-regex-and-digest)
provided in ProxySQL to create context-sensitive rules for better query
distribution.

1.  Declare rules with the following SQL queries:

				INSERT INTO mysql_rules (rule_id, active, match_digest, destination_hostgroup, apply) VALUES (1,1,'^SELECT.*FOR UPDATE',0,1), (2,1,'^SELECT',1,1);
				LOAD MYSQL RULES TO RUNTIME;
				SAVE MYSQL RULES TO DISK;

		The queries add two rules:

		- Distribute all the `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` queries to database servers in
			host group `1`
		- Distribute all the `SELECT` queries to database servers in host group `0`

		Queries that do not match any existing rules go to database servers in host
		group `0` (default).

1.  Add the master instance to host group `1` so that it also helps serve read
		traffic:

				INSERT INTO mysql_servers (hostgroup_id, hostname) VALUES (1, '[IP_ADDRESS]');
				LOAD MYSQL SERVERS TO RUNTIME;
				SAVE MYSQL SERVERS TO DISK;

1.  Adjust the weights of servers in host group `1`:

				UPDATE mysql_servers SET weight = 40 WHERE hostname = '[IP_ADDRESS_1]';
				UPDATE mysql_servers SET weight = 40 WHERE hostname = '[IP_ADDRESS_2]';
				UPDATE mysql_servers SET weight = 20 WHERE hostname = '[IP_ADDRESS]';
				LOAD MYSQL SERVERS TO RUNTIME;
				SAVE MYSQL SERVERS TO DISK;

		Replace `[IP_ADDRESS_1]`, `[IP_ADDRESS_2]`, `[IP_ADDRESS]` with the IP
		addresses of read replica #1, read replica #2, and the master instance
		respectively. The weights are calculated as follows:

				P(Server # Receives the Query) = (Weight of Server #) / (Total Weight of the Host Group)

		Read replica #1 has a weight of 40, so its chance of receiving a query is
		40/100 = 0.4 (40%). Similarly, read replica #2 has a chance of 40% and the
		master instance 20%.

### Scaling Dynamically

You can add or remove read replicas any time you want. When you are adding a
read replica, create it in Cloud SQL as instructed above, add it to the
`mysql_server` table, and update the rules (and/or weights) to route traffic to
it. Removing a read replica, however, takes a few additional steps:

1.  Update the status of the read replica to `OFFLINE_SOFT`:

				UPDATE mysql_servers SET status = 'OFFLINE_SOFT' WHERE hostname = '[IP_ADDRESS]';
				LOAD MYSQL SERVERS TO RUNTIME;
				SAVE MYSQL SERVERS TO DISK;

		The `OFFLINE_SOFT` status flag instructs ProxySQL to stop sending new
		queries to the read replica. Existing connections still persist. Monitor the
		status of the read replica in Cloud Console by going to the
		[Cloud SQL Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances)
		and clicking the read replica you would like to remove. The performance
		chart is available in the Instance Details page. You should see that your
		read replica is no longer used by your application. Note that setting the
		read replica to offline in ProxySQL does not stop it from running in Cloud
		SQL; you are still being charged for the replica. See steps below to remove
		it from Cloud SQL.

1.  If you do not plan to use the read replica any more in the future, delete it
		from `mysql_servers` table:

				DELETE FROM mysql_servers WHERE hostname = '[IP_ADDRESS]';
				LOAD MYSQL SERVERS TO RUNTIME;
				SAVE MYSQL SERVERS TO DISK;

		All the traffic will be terminated immediately, so you should proceed with
		deletion only after you are certain that the read replica has completed all
		the queries sent its way. Use the performance chart (`MySQL queries`,
		`active connections`, etc.) to monitor the status.

		Then remove it from Cloud SQL:

		1.  Go to the [Cloud SQL Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances)
				and click the read replica you would like to remove.

		1.  Click **Delete**. Follow the instructions on screen to delete the
				instance.

1.  Update the rules and weights accordingly.

Unlike the master instance, read replicas cannot be stopped (and then restarted
later) in Cloud SQL. If you plan to add a read replica after deletion, create a
new one and update the ProxySQL settings. The master instance cannot be stopped
or deleted until all the read replicas are deleted.

## Cleaning Up

After finishing this tutorial, you can clean up the resources you created on
Google Cloud Platform so that you are not billed for them in the future. To
clean up, you can delete the whole project or delete the master instance in
Cloud SQL.

### Deleting the Project

Visit the [Manage resources menu](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager).
Select the project you used for this tutorial and click **Delete**. Note that
once the project is deleted, the project ID cannot be reused.

If you have Cloud SDK installed in the system, you can also [use the `gcloud` command-line to delete a project](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/projects/delete).

### Deleting the Master Instance

Go to the [Cloud SQL Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).
If there are still read replicas, remove them one by one. For each one, click
the kebab icon (three vertical dots) and choose **Delete** in the drop down
menu. After all the read replicas are removed, delete the master instance in the
same manner.
