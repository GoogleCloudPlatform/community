Data Science - gleaning insight from data to perform and inform action -
comprises a number of steps, any (or all) of which can aided by tools provided
by the Google Cloud Platform.

[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) provides a set of tools to
enable you to glean actionable insight from arbitrarily large sets of data. To
explore these tools in the Data Science context, it's helpful to enumerate the
steps of which Data Science is commonly comprised. To wit:

* *Data collection*

This document (like Data Science) is a work in progress, and as such is not
comprehensive in its mapping of Data Science steps to available tools. Please
contribute where there are gaps :-)
