**Beta: This is a Beta release of the Google Cloud Platform Community tutorials. This site might be changed and is not subject to any SLA or deprecation policy.**

## Introduction

Beyond the official documentation there are endless possiblities for combining
tools, platforms, languages and products. Ultimately, everything you build is
unique, but very often projects share a lot in common. By submitting a tutorial
you can share your experience and help others who are solving similar problems.

Tutorials can be short or long, but in every case they provide context for
using Google Cloud Platform in the real world and show how to solve a particular
problem that may not have been discussed in the official documentation.

## Submitting a tutorial

Community tutorials are stored in Markdown files [on GitHub][repo] where they
can be reviewed and edited by the community.

To submit a tutorial:

1.  Accept the Contributor License Agreement (CLA):

    [**View the CLA**](#contributor-licence-agreements)

1.  Read the style guide before preparing your submission:

    [**View the style guide**][styleguide]

1.  You can fork GitHub repository and add a new tutorial in one step. Simply
    click the following link to add your Markdown tutorial via the in-browser
    GitHub editor:

    [**Fork and start writing**][fork_quick]

    Below the GitHub editor interface you can find a form and buttons for
    committing your changes and then opening a Pull Request.

    Alternatively, you can manually fork and clone the repo, make and commit
    your changes, and then open a pull request:

    1.  [Fork][fork_btn] the community repository: [github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/community][repo].
    1.  Clone your fork to your local machine.
    1.  Add a new `.md` file to the `tutorials/` folder.
    1.  Commit your changes and open a [Pull Request][pr].

1.  Once you've opened a Pull Request a reviewer will be assigned to review your
    submission. They'll work with you to ensure your submission meets the
    [style guide][styleguide], but it helps if you follow it as you write your
    tutorial.

1.  Once your Pull Request is approved and merged your submission will be
    published.

## Contributor license agreements

We'd love to accept your contributions! Before we can take them, we have to jump
over a few legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA][in_cla].
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA][corp_cla].

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.
