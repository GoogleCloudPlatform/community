This tutorial shows a sample [Swift][swift] app built with [Vapor][vapor]
deployed to Google App Engine.

Vapor is "a web framework and server for Swift that works on macOS and Ubuntu."
It is [open source on GitHub][vapor-github].

This tutorial assumes basic familiarity with Swift programming.

[swift]: http://swift.org
[vapor]: https://vapor.codes
[vapor-github]: https://github.com/vapor/vapor

## Objectives

+ Create a Swift "Hello, world" app that uses the Vapor framework.
+ Deploy the app to the Google App Engine flexible environment.

## Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud Platform, including:

+ Google App Engine flexible environment

Use the [Pricing Calculator][pricing] to generate a cost estimate based on your
projected usage.

## Before you begin

1.  Create a project in the [Google Cloud Platform Console][console].
1.  Enable billing for your project.
1.  Install the [Google Cloud SDK][cloud-sdk].

[cloud-sdk]: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/

## Handling dependencies

We'll use the [Swift Package Manager][spm] to manage our app's dependencies.

1.  Create a `package.swift` file with the following contents:

        import PackageDescription

        let package = Package(
            name: "VaporGAE",
            targets: [
                Target(name: "VaporGAE", dependencies: [])
            ],
            dependencies: [
                .Package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/vapor.git", majorVersion: 1, minor: 1)
            ]
        )

## Writing the server

1.  Create a `main.swift` with the following contents:

        import Foundation
        import Vapor

        let drop = Droplet()

        // Respond to App Engine health check requests
        // TODO: see #2

        // Basic GET request
        // TODO: see #3

        // Start server on 8080 (default)
        drop.run()

1.  Create a route to handle App Engine health-check requests" (per the [custom runtime docs][custom-runtime]):

        // Respond to App Engine health check requests
        drop.get("/_ah/health") { request in
            print("ALL - /_ah/health route handler...")
            return "OK"
        }

1.  Create a route to handle `GET` requests to `/hello`:

        // Basic GET request
        drop.get("/hello") { request in
            print("GET - /hello route handler...")
            return "Hello from Vapor on Google App Engine flexible environment!"
        }

## Creating the `Dockerfile`

Since Swift doesn't have an officially supported App Engine runtime, we'll
create our own.

1.  Create a `Dockerfile` with the following contents:

        FROM ibmcom/swift-ubuntu:latest
        LABEL Description="Docker image for Swift + Vapor on Google App Engine flexible environment."

        # Expose default port for App Engine
        EXPOSE 8080

        # Add app source
        ADD . /app
        WORKDIR /app

        # Build release
        RUN swift build --configuration release

        # Run the app
        ENTRYPOINT [".build/release/VaporGAE"]

## Deploying the app

1.  Create an `app.yaml` file with the following contents:

        runtime: custom
        env: flex

1.  Run the following command to deploy your app (make take several minutes):

        gcloud app deploy

1.  Run the following command to view your app, then append `/hello` to the URL:

        gcloud app browse

If all goes well, you should see "Hello from Swift on Google App Engine flexible environment!".
