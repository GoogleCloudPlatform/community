## What is Corporate Engineering at Google?


At Google, IT services are managed and provided through Corporate Engineering, usually just called Corp Eng. Our mission: "Empower Googlers with World-Leading Technology"

That's a tall order!

Our name is important too. Corp Eng is an engineering team, primarily, and one that doesn't only support products and workers, but also makes things. Across Google we provide best-in-class IT products, whether home-built or third-party, as well as core IT services, risk management and change management.

People at Google need a wide variety of tools to get their jobs done. Corp Eng provides personal hardware to employees, including laptops, desktops, accessories, tablets and more. Every year we go through re-evaluation processes for our hardware selections, making sure that we have found the right vendors and options to enable Googlers to choose the right device for their style. Priorities change with role, location and individual preference, so we make sure to offer multiple choices for each operating system.

We manage and develop our software platforms to support that hardware, including custom images for Windows, Mac and Linux distributions, and supporting software for ChromeOS, iOS and Android. We also support virtualized systems, and the administration behind them, so Googlers can work from home if circumstances keep them from accessing their usual workstation. To keep all this software flowing we have created and developed systems to distribute and monitor software across our fleet, and to help us administer our G Suite instance.

When we do have the opportunity to be in our offices, we end up taking a lot of meetings that connect us with people around the world, so we need ubiquitous, reliable meeting rooms. Corp Eng designs, deploys and supports video conferencing systems across tens of thousands of rooms. On top of that we work with our facilities teams to specify needs for larger spaces, whether equipping them to host talks, performances or other big events. Those frequently get hundreds of in-person attendees and need to record audio and video for production and publication online.

Despite loving our laptops, sometimes we also need to make phone calls, and for that Corp Eng provides telephony services. That could be as simple as providing a desk phone or mobile phone for a person in sales who is on calls most of the day, or virtual telephony for more efficient and adaptable use cases. This extends to support teams, often in large call centers, who need the right systems to manage and monitor the steady stream of phone calls coming their way.

All that work covers what we need to do as a foundation for Googlers getting their stuff done, and getting started when they join. What about making the workplace more efficient for them as they go about their days? Corp Eng also creates mobile products to help people navigate our offices, digital signage to help notify employees about events and announcements, and automated systems to make meetings more efficient. We have applications to help people find flights and hotels quickly. And of course printers, who could forget printers? Yup, we've got that.

We help with onboarding new employees, to give them a rundown of what the technology experience will be, what they can expect, and how to navigate it. On their first day we're there to help them with security keys, laptops and any access or account questions, so they can be productive as fast as possible, often less than an hour after they walk in the door.

It can be really intimidating for a new employee to try to figure out "Who do I ask about this?" or "What's the policy on this?" as they are learning their jobs, so we've got tools to help with knowledge and search. We are a search company! Corp Eng and the Search teams have collaborated to add many types of content to our internal enterprise search products, and customized our internal directory to provide quick, useful information about people, projects and teams. We also support products that help the community share insights (or jokes) and democratically elevate questions for big meetings so our leadership can address the most concerns democratically.

And when things break, we're here to fix!

Corp Eng provides in-person tech support, remote support via chat, email and (yes) phone, as well as self-service resources to enable employees to solve their own problems. And we constantly look at common root causes to find ways to make problems disappear entirely, through preventative means.

Empowering Googlers with world leading technology is a fun job, and sometimes a creative challenge. We're happy to have that as our mandate, and look forward to discovering new ways we can make the technology experience for our employees better and better.
