This tutorial shows how to query the public GitHub dataset on Google BigQuery
in order to determine the most popular NPM packages among public projects on
GitHub.

## Objectives

* Run a simple query to determine how many `package.json` files exist on GitHub
* Run a complex query to determine the most popular top-level NPM imports on
  GitHub

## Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud Platform, including:

* Google BigQuery

## Before you begin

1.  Select or create a [Google Cloud Platform Console][console] project.
    [Go to the projects page][projects].
1.  Enable billing for your project. [Enable billing][billing].

[console]: https://console.cloud.google.com/
[projects]: https://console.cloud.google.com/project
[billing]: https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499#enable-billing

## The BigQuery console

Navigate to [bigquery.cloud.google.com/welcome/YOUR_PROJECT_ID][bigquery_console]
to start running queries.

[bigquery_console]: https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/welcome/YOUR_PROJECT_ID

When querying data BigQuery charges $5 (USD) per terabyte of data processed,
where the first terabyte (1 TB) per month is free.

The queries in this tutorial will process more than 1 TB, which is why billing
must be enabled.

## How many package.json files are on GitHub?

1.  In the BigQuery console click **Compose Query** and paste in the following SQL
    query:

        SELECT
          COUNT(*) AS num_files
        FROM [bigquery-public-data:github_repos.files]
          WHERE
            RIGHT(path, 12) = "package.json"

1.  Click **Run Query** to execute the query, which should only take a few
    seconds.
1.  You should see a result like the following:

## Which NPM packages are imported the most on GitHub?

1.  In the BigQuery console click **Compose Query** and paste in the following SQL
    query:

        SELECT
          COUNT(*) as times_imported, package
        FROM
          JS(
            (SELECT content FROM [bigquery-public-data:github_repos.contents] WHERE id IN (
              SELECT id FROM [bigquery-public-data:github_repos.files] WHERE RIGHT(path, 12) = "package.json"
            )),
            content,
            "[{ name: 'package', type: 'string'}]",
            "function(row, emit) {
              try {
                x = JSON.parse(row.content);
                if (x.dependencies) {
                  Object.keys(x.dependencies).forEach(function(dep) {
                    emit({ package: dep });
                  });
                }
              } catch (e) {}
            }"
          )
        GROUP BY package
        ORDER BY times_imported DESC
        LIMIT 1000

1.  Click **Run Query** to execute the query, which should take 2-3 minutes and
    process several terabytes of data.
1.  You should see a result like the following:

    ![query-2](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/github-bigquery-npm-packages/query-2.png)

There you have it, the most imported NPM packages on GitHub!
