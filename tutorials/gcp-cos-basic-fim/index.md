[This example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/community/tree/master/tutorials/gcp-cos-basic-fim) provides a basic FIM Docker image with regularly scheduled scans.

This example is designed to be run on Google Container-Optimized OS, but will work with most other Docker servers.

basic-fim is an open source file integrity monitoring application that monitors for files that are new, altered, or deleted.

## Docker Usage
1. Modify the following script to define your data directory and the path to monitor:
    ```
    BASEDIR="/YOUR_DOCKER_APP_DATA_PATH/fim"
    NAME=fim
    IMAGE=ianmaddox/basic-fim
    TAG=latest
    FIM_DIR=/PATH/TO/MONITOR

    docker stop $NAME
    docker rm $NAME
    docker pull $IMAGE:$TAG
    docker create \
      --name $NAME \
      -v $BASEDIR/logs:/logs \
      -v $BASEDIR/data:/root/.fim \
      -v $FIM_DIR:/host-fs:ro \
      -e FIM_IGNORE_PATH="*/tmp/*" \
      -e FIM_THREADS="8" \
      -e FIM_PATH="/host-fs" \
      -e TZ="America/Los_Angeles" \
      $IMAGE:$TAG

    ```
1. Define and override env vars (listed below) as needed
1. Launch the container
1. Monitor the logs

## Kubernetes Usage

1. Override env vars shown below as needed
1. Build your Docker image.
1. Deploy that image to your Kubernetes cluster.
1. Use Daemonsets to configure the new workload to run one scanner pod per node.
1. Ensure that scan-required paths within other pods are mounted as named volumes so they will be included in the scan of
   the node.

## Env vars:
```
Var              Default      Desc
FIM_PATH         [/host-fs]   Path to monitor
FIM_THREADS      [4]          Number of threads to use when hashing
FIM_SYMLINKS     [false]      Follow symlinks found in FIM_PATH
FIM_DATDIR       [/root/.fim] Data file directory
FIM_LOGDIR       [/logs]      Log file directory
FIM_IGNORE_FILE  []           Glob file ignore filter
FIM_IGNORE_PATH  []           Glob path ignore filter
```
