[This example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/community/tree/master/tutorials/gcp-cos-basic-fim) provides a basic FIM Docker image with regularly scheduled scans.

This example is designed to be run on Google Container-Optimized OS, but should work with most other Docker servers.

basic-fim is an open source file integrity monitoring application that monitors for files that are new, altered, or deleted.

## Basic usage

1. Build your Docker image.
1. Deploy that image to your Kubernetes cluster.
1. Use Daemonsets to configure the new workload to run one scanner pod per node.
1. Ensure that scan-required paths within other pods are mounted as named volumes so they will be included in the scan of 
   the node.
