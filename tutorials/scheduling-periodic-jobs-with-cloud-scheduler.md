Automating tasks that re-occur is definitely at the heart of every software developer. Google Cloud provides Cloud Scheduler,
a tool that allows users to schedule jobs with the conventional unix-cron format.  

Cloud Scheduler can be referred to as a *cron-job-as-a-service* tool. It is fully managed by Google Cloud, so you don't need 
to manage the scheduler's underlying infrastructure.

Cloud Scheduler can be used for multiple use cases, such as making requests to an HTTP/S endpoint, invoking a Pub/Sub topic, 
making database updates and push notifications, triggering CI/CD pipelines, scheduling tasks such as image uploads and 
sending email, and even invoking Cloud Functions.

## Objective

In this tutorial, you use Cloud Scheduler to make simple requests to an HTTP endpoint.  

## Before you begin

1. Set up a [Google Cloud account and project](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/getting-started/).

1. Enable [Cloud Scheduler](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudscheduler).

1. Copy the URL of the HTTP endpoint that you would like to make requests to.

## Get the sample code

The [author of this tutorial](https://github.com/Timtech4u) built a tool that periodically makes request to Cloud Run
services to prevent them from having cold starts. Get the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Timtech4u/cloudrun_warmer).

## Setting up Cloud Scheduler 

1.  Visit [Cloud Scheduler](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudscheduler) and click **Create Job**

1.  Enter the job name.

1.  **Frequency**: Enter `every 24 hours`, or enter another value to suit your use case.

1.  **Target**: Select **HTTP**.

1.  **URL**: Enter the application or function URL.

1.  **HTTP Method**: Select **GET**.

1.  Click **Create**.

If you face problems with HTTP headers or other issues while using Cloud Scheduler, check out
[John Hanley's](https://twitter.com/NeoPrimeAws) answers on
[Stack Overflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:8016720+[google-cloud-scheduler). 

Cloud Scheduler can also be used with Firebase Cloud Functions, which automatically configures Cloud Scheduler, along with a
Pub/Sub topic that invokes the function that you define using the Cloud Functions for Firebase SDK.

Stackdriver integrates with Cloud Scheduler, providing powerful logging for greater transparency into job execution and
performance.

## Pricing

Cloud Scheduler is simple and pay-for-use. You pay for the number of jobs you use each month. Google Cloud allows you create
three free jobs per month, and you pay for others at $0.10/job/month.
