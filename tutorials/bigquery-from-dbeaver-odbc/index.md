[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) is a managed, serverless data warehouse for storing and querying massive datasets. To access these datasets, you 
need some kind of tool that understands the BigQuery API, or you can use an ODBC driver that can work with a wide range of ODBC-compliant tools, as a data 
access layer.

Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is an API that allows external applications to access data in various database management systems. The ODBC driver acts as an 
interface between an external database and an ODBC data source.

This tutorial shows you how to use the [ODBC Driver for BigQuery](https://www.devart.com/odbc/bigquery/) to connect and access data in a BigQuery data warehouse 
using DBeaver Community, a free database administration tool.  

## Objectives

* Install the ODBC Driver for BigQuery.
* Configure a DSN for the driver.
* Access BigQuery data from DBeaver Community.

## Before you begin

This tutorial assumes that you're using the Microsoft Windows operating system.

1.  Create an account with the BigQuery free tier. See
    [this video from Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4mzE--sprY&list=PLIivdWyY5sqI6Jd0SbqviEgoA853EvDsq&index=2) for detailed instructions.
1.  Create a project in the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
1.  Install [DBeaver Community for Windows](https://dbeaver.io/download/).


## Costs

BigQuery is a billable web service. The first 1 TB of query data processed per month and the first 10 GB of storage per month are free. 

See the [BigQuery pricing page](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) for details.   

## Download the driver

1.  Download the latest version of [Devart ODBC Driver for BigQuery](https://www.devart.com/odbc/bigquery/download.html) for Windows.
1.  Run the ODBC driver installer.

    The installation wizard offers to install the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the driver. Confirm both versions if you are planning to use the driver with
    older external applications. The driver offers a 30-day trial period, with no credit card required.  

## Configure a DSN for the driver

1.  Run the ODBC data source administrator (64-bit) application.
1.  Select the **User DSN** or **System DSN** tab, depending on whether you want to create a DSN for the current user or for all user accounts that exist in your
    Windows system
1.  Click **Add** and select **Devart ODBC Driver for Google BigQuery**.
1.  Specify the name for your data source, your **Project ID**, and **Dataset ID**.
1.  Click **Request Refresh Token**. Follow the prompts to authorize the driver to view and manage your data in BigQuery.
1.  Check the **Save Token** box.
1.  Open the **Advanced** settings tab and select **Ansi strings** in **String Types**. 
1.  Click **OK** to save the DSN.

## Connect and access BigQuery data

After the DSN is configured, run DBeaver Community. 

### Create a new database connection

1. Click **New Database Connection**.
2. Select **ODBC** in the list of data sources and click **Next**.
3. Specify your DSN in the **Database** field and click  **Finish**.

You can now expand the created ODBC data source in the **Database Navigator** pane to see existing objects in your BigQuery project.

### Enter a query

1. Right-click the data source and select **SQL Editor**.
2. In the SQL Editor that opens in a new tab, enter your SQL statement.
3. Press `CTRL + Enter` on your keyboard to execute the statement.

The following image shows the results of executing a select statement against a sample **head_office** table that contains employee information:

Similarly, you can run insert, update, or delete statements against your dataset. The choice of data access tools is not limited to ODBC-compliant applications. 
You can run queries directly from code in programming languages, like Python and PHP.
