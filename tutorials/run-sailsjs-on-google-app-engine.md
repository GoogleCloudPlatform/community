You can check out [Node.js and Google Cloud Platform][nodejs-gcp] to get an
overview of Node.js itself and learn ways to run Node.js apps on Google Cloud
Platform.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a project in the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
1. Enable billing for your project.
1. Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).

## Prepare

1. Install the Sails.js CLI tool:

        npm install -g sails

1. Create a new Sails.js project (this may take a moment):

        sails new testProject

1. Change directory into the new project:

        cd testProject

## Run

1. Run the app with the following command:

        sails lift

1. Visit [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) to see the new project's
home page.

## Deploy

1. Create an `app.yaml` file with the following contents:

        runtime: nodejs
        env: flex

1. Run the following command to deploy your app:

        gcloud app deploy

1. Visit `http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com` to see the `Hello World!` message.

Note: When the the Sails.js app is deployed it will automatically switch to
production mode and listen on the correct port.
