This tutorial demonstrates how to use [Cloud Container Builder][gcb] as
a continuous integration service for GitHub repositories. You will implement a
[Cloud Function][gcf] which listens to build events and updates the
build status in GitHub using the [Statuses API][statuses]. The function is
implemented in [Node.js][node].

[gcb]: https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/docs/
[gcf]: https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/
[statuses]: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/
[node]: https://nodejs.org/en/

## Prerequisites

1.  Create a project in the [Google Cloud Platform Console][console].
1.  [Enable billing][billing] for your project.
1.  Install the [Cloud SDK][sdk].

[console]: https://console.cloud.google.com/
[billing]: https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499#enable-billing
[sdk]: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/

## Set up automated builds

You will use [Cloud Container Builder][gcb] and the [Build Triggers][bt]
feature to upload your website automatically every time you push a new git
commit to the source repository.

> Note: If you do not have a repository on GitHub, you can fork [this sample
> repository][sample-repo] for the purposes of this tutorial.

Head over to the Container Registry &rarr; [Build Triggers][triggers]
section on Google Cloud Platform Console and click **Add trigger**:

![Add build trigger on Container Registry section](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/cloud-functions-github-container-builder/add-trigger-button.png)

Then select **GitHub** as the source of your repository. You may need to authorize
access to your GitHub account so that Cloud Source Repositories can mirror and
create commit hooks on your GitHub repositories.

![Select GitHub as the source](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/cloud-functions-github-container-builder/select-source.png)

Then, pick your repository from the list. If you forked the sample repository
above, pick it here:

![Select the Git repository](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/cloud-functions-github-container-builder/select-repo.png)

For the **Trigger settings**:

- choose Trigger Type **Branch**
- choose Build Configuration **cloudbuild.yaml**
- Set the file location to `cloudbuild.yaml`

![Create build trigger](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/cloud-functions-github-container-builder/create-trigger.png)

Now, create a `cloudbuild.yaml` file with the following contents in your
repository. Note that you can add files to your repository on GitHubâ€™s website, or
by cloning the repository on your development machine:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/git
    args: ["show", "README.md"]
```

This YAML file declares a build step with the `git show` command. It prints
the contents of README.md to the build logs.

After saving the file, commit and push the changes:

    $ git add cloudbuild.yaml
    $ git commit -m 'Add build configuration'
    $ git push

[sample-repo]: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/web-docs-samples
[triggers]: https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/triggers

### Trigger the first build

Once you push the `cloudbuild.yaml` file to your repository and create the Build
Trigger, you can kick off the first build manually. Head over to the Google
Cloud Platform Console [Build Triggers][triggers] section, click **Run
trigger** and choose the the branch (i.e. master) to build.

![Trigger the first build manually](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/cloud-functions-github-container-builder/trigger-build.png)

Now click **Build history** on the left and watch the build job execute and
succeed:

![Build history shows the executing or completed builds](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/cloud-functions-github-container-builder/build-history.png)

Remember that after now, every commit pushed to any branch of your GitHub
repository will trigger a new build. If you need to change which git branches
or tags you use for publishing, you can update the Build Trigger configuration.

## Preparing the Cloud Function

1.  Run the following commands in a new empty directory.
1.  Create a `package.json` file by running the following command:

        $ npm init

1.  Run the following command to install the dependencies that the function
    uses to make REST calls to the GitHub API:

        $ npm install --save --save-exact @octokit/rest@15.2.6

### Writing the Function Code

Create a file named `index.js` with the following contents:

[embedmd]:# (index.js)
```js
'use strict';

const octokit = require('@octokit/rest')();
const GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN = '[TOKEN]';

/**
 * Background Cloud Function to be triggered by cloud-builds Pub/Sub topic.
 *
 * @param {object} event The Cloud Functions event.
 */
exports.gcb_github = (event) => {
  const build = eventToBuild(event.data.data);
  return postBuildStatus(build);
};

// eventToBuild transforms pubsub event message to a build object.
const eventToBuild = (data) => {
  return JSON.parse(new Buffer(data, 'base64').toString());
}

function postBuildStatus(build) {
  octokit.authenticate({
    type: 'token',
    token: GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
  });

  let repo = getRepo(build);
  if (repo === null || repo.site !== 'github') {
    return Promise.resolve();
  }
  let [ state, description ] = buildToGithubStatus(build);
  return octokit.repos.createStatus({
    owner: repo.user,
    repo: repo.name,
    sha: build.sourceProvenance.resolvedRepoSource.commitSha,
    state: state,
    description: description,
    context: 'gcb',
    target_url: build.logUrl
  });
}

function getRepo(build) {
  let repoNameRe = /^([^-]*)-([^-]*)-(.*)$/;
  let repoName = build.source.repoSource.repoName;
  let match = repoNameRe.exec(repoName);
  if (!match) {
    console.error(`Cannot parse repoName: ${repoName}`);
    return null;
  }
  return {
    site: match[1],
    user: match[2],
    name: match[3]
  };
}

function buildToGithubStatus(build) {
  let map = {
    QUEUED: ['pending', 'Build is queued'],
    WORKING: ['pending', 'Build is being executed'],
    FAILURE: ['error', 'Build failed'],
    INTERNAL_ERROR: ['failure', 'Internal builder error'],
    CANCELLED: ['failure', 'Build cancelled by user'],
    TIMEOUT: ['failure', 'Build timed out'],
    SUCCESS: ['success', 'Build finished successfully']
  }
  return map[build.status];
}
```

The container builder publishes messages in the `cloud-builds`
[Pub/Sub][pubsub] topic. Each message triggers our cloud function with the
message contents passed as input data. The message contains the [build][build]
response. Here is an example of a build response, reduced to the most relevant
fields:

```json
{
  "id": "3e3c9152-6ba9-b562-e9c6-a49651c076ce",
  "projectId": "my-google-cloud-project-1234",
  "status": "WORKING",
  "source": {
      "repoSource": {
          "projectId": "my-google-cloud-project-1234",
          "repoName": "github-myowner-myreponame",
          "branchName": "master"
      }
  },
  "sourceProvenance": {
    "resolvedRepoSource": {
      "commitSha": "29d39613fa9958598228f7f162b3f03ab4189ece"
    }
  },
  "logUrl": "https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/builds/3e3c9152-6ba9-b562-e9c6-a49651c076ce?project=1234567890"
};
```

The function then determines the GitHub repository owner and name, maps the
build status (`WORKING`, `FAILURE`, `SUCCESS`) to a commit state (`pending`,
`error`, `success`), and POST's to the Statuses API.

### Generating a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Read about [Creating a personal access token for the command line][token].
1. Select `repo:status` from the scopes.
1. Substitute the generated token for `[TOKEN]` in `index.js`.

> Note: To create statuses you must have write access to the target repository.
> POST's to the Statuses API will return a `NOT FOUND` error otherwise.

[token]: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/

## Deploying the Cloud Function

1.  Read about [deploying Cloud Functions][deploying].
1.  Run the following command to deploy the function:

        $ gcloud beta functions deploy gcb_github --stage-bucket [YOUR_STAGE_BUCKET] --trigger-topic cloud-builds

    Replace `[YOUR_STAGE_BUCKET]` with your Cloud Functions staging bucket,
    e.g. gs://[PROJECT_ID]_cloudbuild.

## Testing the integration

Trigger another build manually. The commit status is shown as a check mark or X mark in
the commit log in GitHub. More details of the build status are shown in Pull Requests.

You can check the [logs][logs] for errors.
