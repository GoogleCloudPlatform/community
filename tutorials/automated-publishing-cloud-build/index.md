This tutorial shows how to automate publishing a static HTML website using a
custom domain name to Google Cloud Storage using [Google Cloud Build][gcb].

## Objectives

- Automatically publish changes to your static website from the source control
  repository.

## Before you begin

1. Make sure you have a custom domain name (e.g. example.com).
1. Make sure the source code for your static website is hosted on a GitHub or
   BitBucket repository.
1. Make sure you verified ownership of your domain on [Google Webmaster
   Central][gwc]. (Do not include `http://` or `https://` in the URL for the
   purposes of this demo.)
1. Make sure you have a Project on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console to
   host your website.

## Set up a storage bucket

By uploading your website contents as files to Cloud Storage, you can
[host your static website][gcs-hosting] on buckets. First, you need to create a
bucket. Head to the [Storage][p6n-storage] section of the GCP Console and type
in your domain name (e.g. `www.example.com`) and create the bucket:

![Create a bucket named as your domain
name](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build/create-bucket.png)

After the bucket is created, you need to make it readable by everyone. Go to the
[Storage Browser][p6n-storage] on the GCP Console, click the menu icon
to the right of the bucket, and select “Edit Object Default Permissions”:

![Change object default permissions of the
bucket](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build/change-defacl.png)

Then add the user `allUsers` with “Reader” role and click “Save”:

![Add allUsers as
HeReader](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build/add-allUsers.png)

Now, you need to configure the storage bucket to serve a static website. Click
the “Edit Website Configuration” button on the list of buckets:

![Edit Website
Configuration](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build/configure-website-button.png)

Specify the main page as "index.html" and click “Save”:

![Specify main
page](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build/configure-website.png)

Now, configure your domain name’s DNS records to [create a CNAME
record][gcs-hosting] that points to Cloud Storage. This makes clients
requesting your website point to Cloud Storage APIs.

## Set up automated builds

You will use [Cloud Build][gcb] and the [Build Triggers][bt]
feature to upload your website automatically every time you push a new git
commit to the source repository.

> Note: If you do not have a repository on GitHub, you can fork [this sample
> repository][sample-repo] for the purposes of this tutorial.

Head over to the Cloud Build &rarr; [Build Triggers][p6n-triggers]
section on the GCP Console and click “Add trigger”:

![Add build trigger on Container Registry
section](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build/add-trigger-button.png)

Then select GitHub as the source of your repository. In the next screen, you may
be asked to authorize access to your GitHub account and repositories. This is
needed for Google Cloud Source Repositories to mirror and create commit hooks on
your GitHub repositories.

![Select GitHub as the
source](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build/select-source.png)

Then, pick your repository from the list. If you forked the sample repository
above, pick it here:

![Select the Git
repository](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build/select-repo.png)

In the next screen

- give this Build Trigger a name (e.g. publish-website)
- choose Build Configuration "cloudbuild.yaml"
- choose Trigger Type ”Branch”
- Set the file location to `cloudbuild.yaml`

![Create build
trigger](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build/create-trigger.png)

Now, create a `cloudbuild.yaml` file with the following contents in your
repository. Note that you can add files to your repository on GitHub’s website, or
by cloning the repository on your development machine:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/gsutil
    args: ["-m", "rsync", "-r", "-c", "-d", "./vision/explore-api", "gs://hello.alp.im"]
```

This YAML file declares a build step with the `gsutil -m rsync` command and
makes sure that the website is uploaded to the storage bucket. The `-m` flag
accelerates upload by processing multiple files in parallel and the `-c` flag
avoids re-uploading unchanged files.

If you are using the sample repository, you should upload the
`./vision/explore-api/` directory. If you would like to upload your entire
repository to the storage bucket, make sure to change this value to `.` in the
YAML file.

The last command in the `args` is the name of your storage bucket prefixed with
`gs://`. Be sure to change this argument to the correct value.

After saving the file, commit and push the changes:

    git add cloudbuild.yaml
    git commit -m 'Add build configuration'
    git push

### Trigger the first build

Once you push the `cloudbuild.yaml` file to your repository and create the Build
Trigger, you can kick off the first build manually. Head over to the GCP Console
[Build Triggers][p6n-triggers] section, click “Run
Trigger”, and choose the branch (i.e. master) to build.

![Trigger the first build
manually](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build/trigger-build.png)

Now click the “Build history” on the left and watch the build job execute and
succeed:

![Build history shows the executing or completed
builds](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build/build-history.png)

Remember that after now, every commit pushed to any branch of your GitHub
repository will trigger a new build and publish contents to your website. If you
need to change which git branches or tags you use for publishing, you can update
the Build Trigger configuration.

## Try it out

Point your browser to your website URL and see if it works:

## Clean up

After you no longer need the artifacts of this tutorial, you can clean up the
following resources on Google Cloud Platform Console to prevent incurring
additional charges:

- Storage: delete bucket named as your website
- Container Registry &rarr; Build Triggers: delete build trigger
- Development &rarr; Repositories: delete mirrored repository
