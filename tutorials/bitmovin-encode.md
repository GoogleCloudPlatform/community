This document explains how to set up Bitmovin Encoding on Google Cloud infrastructure so that the Bitmovin platform can run encoders using the Compute Engine 
API. 

The instructions in this document for the [Bitmovin Encoding Service](https://bitmovin.com/encoding-service/) apply to live encoding and file-based encoding. For
a complete list of formats and input types, see the [Bitmovin website](https://bitmovin.com/docs/encoding/articles/supported-input-and-output-formats).

## Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account)
* [Google Cloud project created](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
* [Compute Engine API enabled](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/compute.googleapis.com)

## Create service account

1.  [Create a service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) with Compute Admin permissions. This is needed for the compute-related
    permissions on the infrastructure side, such as starting and stopping instances. 
    
1.  Create a key for the service account and download the JSON file containing the private key. The following information is needed from the JSON file
    to create an `InfrastructureId` on the Bitmovin platform, which can then be used to run encodings on a customer's Compute Engine infrastructure:

    * `project_id`
    * `private_key`
    * `client_email`

## Set up mandatory firewall rules

These are the basic firewall rules, without which starting an encoding will fail.

1.  Go to the [Firewall page](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/firewalls/list) in the Cloud Console and click **Create firewall rule**.
1.  Use the settings described in the following table for the new firewall rule:

    | Field        | Value to set           | 
    | ------------- |-------------| 
    | Name      | encoder-service | 
    | Description      | For communication with the service that manages the encoding      | 
    | Logs | Off                        | 
    | Network | default                 | 
    | Priority | 1000                   | 
    | Direction | Ingress               | 
    | Action on match | Allow           | 
    | Targets | All instances in the network                  | 
    | Source filters | Contact Bitmovin for details.         | 
    | Protocols and ports | Contact Bitmovin for details.    | 

1.  Repeat the process for the next three firewall rules:

    | Field        | Value to set           | 
    | ------------- |-------------| 
    | Name | session-manager-external               | 
    | Description | For communication with the service that manages the encoding instances               | 


    | Field        | Value to set           | 
    | ------------- |-------------| 
    | Name | default-allow           | 
    | Description | For incoming commands (for example, pulling and starting docker containers)             | 


    | Field        | Value to set           | 
    | ------------- |-------------| 
    | Name | default-allow-internal             | 
    | Description | For communication between the session manager VM instance and its instance manager VM instances    | 


## Set up firewall rules for live streams

Additional firewall rules are required for encoding RTMP, SRT, and Zixi live streams. 

### Firewall rules necessary for RTMP live streams 

If you intend to run RTMP live streams, create a firewall rule with the following settings:

| Field   |   Value to set |
| ------------- |-------------| 
| Name | rtmp-listener  |
| Description    | For RTMP live streams  |
| Logs  | Off  |
| Network  | default  |
| Priority | 1000 |
| Direction | Ingress |
| Action on match | Allow|
| Targets | All instances in the network                  | 
| Source filters | Contact Bitmovin for details.         | 
| Protocols and ports | Contact Bitmovin for details.    | 

### Firewall rules necessary for SRT live streams

If you intend to run SRT live streams, create a firewall rule with the following settings:

| Field        | Value to set           | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| Name | srt-listener               | 
| Description |  For SRT live streams                | 
| Targets | All instances in the network                  | 
| Source filters | Contact Bitmovin for details.         | 
| Protocols and ports | Contact Bitmovin for details.    | 

### Firewall rules necessary for Zixi live streams

If you intend to run Zixi live streams, create a firewall rule with the following settings:

| Field        | Value to set           | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| Name | zixi-listener               | 
| Description |  For Zixi live streams                | 
| Targets | All instances in the network                  | 
| Source filters | Contact Bitmovin for details.         | 
| Protocols and ports | Contact Bitmovin for details.    | 

## Create infrastructure

This step involves executing the
[Bitmovin infrastructure API](https://bitmovin.com/docs/encoding/api-reference/sections/infrastructure#/Encoding/PostEncodingInfrastructureGce) for adding a
Google Cloud account.

Using the add `GCE Account API`, use the following JSON and replace the respective `serviceAccountEmail`, `privateKey`, and `projectId` values with values from 
your Google Cloud service account:
 
    {  
    "name": "Name of the resource",   
    "description": "Description of the resource",
    "customData": "string",
    "serviceAccountEmail": "bitmovin-connect-account@my-gcp-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "privateKey": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nLoads\nOf\nStuff\nThats\nAll\nSecret\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
    "projectId": "my-gcp-project"
    }


The `serviceAccountEmail` (`client_email`), `privateKey`, and `projectId` values can be retrieved from the JSON file as described in the "Create service account" 
section.

## Request access to machine images

The Bitmovin platform uses private machine images (MIs) for encoder instances in Compute Engine. Ask your Bitmovin technical contact with your Google Cloud
service account details so that your account has access to these machine images.

## Run encoding jobs

Just like using the Bitmovin managed encoding service, you can use the Bitmovin API client SDKs to submit encoding jobs. The only difference is that you should 
specify the new infrastructure instead of public cloud regions. Here is a Python snippet demonstrating this:

    infra_id = ‘122c1111-9273-4d5f-a3fb-36100e90c709’ # Infrastructure object created
    infra_region = CloudRegion.GOOGLE_EUROPE_WEST_1# GCP region of the GPP-connect setup
    infrastructure = Infrastructure(infra_id, infra_region)
    encoding = Encoding(name='gcp connect encoding',
                        cloud_region=CloudRegion.EXTERNAL,
                        infrastructure=infrastructure,
                        encoder_version='STABLE')

## Google Cloud resource quotas

If you want to run several encodings in parallel, then the default quotas may not be sufficient. In that case, you will have to request limit 
increases for the following quotas in your regions:

| Quota name        | Limit to request           | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| In-use IP addresses | (maximum number of encodings) * (maximum number of instances per encoding)              | 
| CPUs | (maximum number of encodings) * 8 |
| Preemptible CPUs | (maximum number of encodings) * (maximum number of instances per encoding) * 8 |
| Persistent Disk SSD (TB) | (maximum number of encodings) * 0.5 + ((number of instances) * (number of encodings)) * 0.05  |

The values above assume 8-core instances. If your use case requires instances with a different number of cores, contact Bitmovin.

The maximum number of instances needed depends on the maximum number of parallel encodings multiplied by the maximum number of instances for one encoding. The
number of instances used by one encoding varies depending on the input file size and the number and data rate of the encoder representations.

Generally, it is a good idea to multiply the expected limit calculated for your current situation by 2, to have some margin in case you need to ramp up.

To view and edit your quotas, go to the [Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas) in the Cloud Console.
