This two-part tutorial demonstrates how to control an [Arduino Microcontroller](https://www.arduino.cc/) with a
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), connect the devices to [IoT Core](https://cloud.google.com/iot-core/),
post sensor data from the devices, and analyze the data in real time.
[Part 1](https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/ardu-pi-serial-part-1) of the tutorial created a *hybrid*
device, combining the strengths of a Linux-based microprocessor with internet connectivity and TLS stack, together with a 
constrained microcontroller for analog I/O.

## Part 2 objectives

- Process sensor data from Pub/Sub using Dataflow.
- Store processed sensor data in BigQuery.
- Create a report dashboard using Google Data Studio.
- Create a notebook on Datalab.

## Before you begin

This tutorial assumes that you already have a [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) 
account set up and have [Part 1](https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/ardu-pi-serial-part-1) of the tutorial 
working.

## Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud, including the following:

- IoT Core
- Pub/Sub
- Dataflow
- BigQuery
- Datalab

This tutorial should not generate any usage that would not be covered by the [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/), 
but you can use the [Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to generate a cost estimate based on
your projected production usage.

## Enable Dataflow for your project

Perform all of the steps in the "Before you begin" section of the
[Dataflow Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-python)—through creating a Cloud 
Storage bucket—on your local development environment (e.g., laptop).

## Enable BigQuery for your project

Perform all of the steps in the "Before you begin" section of the
[BigQuery Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-web-ui).

## Install environment dependencies and the Cloud SDK

1.  Clone the source repository:

        $ git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/community.git

2.  Change to the directory for this tutorial:

        $ cd community/tutorials/ardu-pi-serial-part-2
    
3.  Create and activate the virtual environment:

        $ virtualenv my_virtual_env
        $ . ./my_virtual_env/bin/activate
        $ pip install -r beam-requirements.txt

4.  Follow the steps in [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) to install the Cloud SDK.

## Create a BigQuery dataset

[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) is Google's fully managed serverless and highly scalable enterprise data
warehouse solution.

A BigQuery [dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets-intro) contains tables and views in a specified single 
region or a geography containing multiple regions. Follow the
[instructions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets) to create a dataset in your project. The dataset location 
can only be specified while creating it. More details are available
[here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations).

## Start the Dataflow job

[Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/) is a fully managed service for transforming and enriching data in
stream (real-time) and batch (historical) modes with equal reliability and expressiveness using the
[Apache Beam SDK](https://beam.apache.org/). 

Select your preferred Dataflow [service region](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints).

Run the command below to start the Apache Beam pipeline on the Dataflow runner.

    $ python -m beam-solarwind --project [project_name] \
    --topic [pub_sub_topic_name (e.g., projects/my-project/topics/my-topic)] \
    --temp_location gs://[cloud_storage_bucket]/tmp \
    --setup_file ./setup.py \
    --region [your_preferred_region] \
    --runner DataflowRunner \
    --output "[bigquery_table_dataset].[table_name]" \
    --output_avg "[bigquery_average_table_dataset].[table_avg]" 

Go to the [Dataflow](https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow) interface in the GCP Console and select your 
newly created Dataflow job to see your pipeline.

The following diagram shows an example Dataflow pipeline:

![DF job](https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-community/tutorials/ardu-pi-serial-part-2/df-job.png)

The first part of the Dataflow job sets up the pipeline options with the required parameters passed through the 
command-line parameters, as shown above. The `streaming mode` option is also enabled. To allow access to the modules 
available in the main session, the `save_main_session` flag is set. After this, the beam pipeline object is created.

    args, pipeline_args = parser.parse_known_args(argv)
    options = PipelineOptions(pipeline_args)
    options.view_as(SetupOptions).save_main_session = True
    options.view_as(StandardOptions).streaming = True
    p = beam.Pipeline(options=options)

The first two steps of the Dataflow pipeline read incoming events from Pub/Sub and then parse the JSON text:

    records = (p | 'Read from PubSub' >> beam.io.ReadFromPubSub(
        topic=args.topic) | 'Parse JSON to Dict' >> beam.Map(
            json.loads))

There are two branches at the next step. The one on the right in the figure above writes the incoming stream of events to 
the raw BigQuery table. The table is created if it does not exist.

    # Write to the raw table
    records | 'Write to BigQuery' >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(
        args.output,
        schema=Schema.get_warehouse_schema(),
        create_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_IF_NEEDED,
        write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_APPEND)

The one on the left aggregates the events and writes them to the BigQuery average table.

1.  Use the timestamp in the event object and emit it with the object. This is then used to create a sliding window of 300
    seconds that starts every 30 seconds.

        records | 'Add timestamp' >> beam.ParDo(AddTimestampToDict()) |
             'Window' >> beam.WindowInto(beam.window.SlidingWindows(
                 300, 60, offset=0))
                 
2.  At the next stage, the record is emitted as a `key-value` tuple, in which the `clientid` is the key and the object is 
    the value.

        'Dict to KeyValue' >> beam.ParDo(AddKeyToDict())
    
3.  The elements are grouped by the clientid key, and the averages of all the metrics (temperature, pressure, etc.) are 
    calculated.

        'Group by Key' >> beam.GroupByKey() |
        'Average' >> beam.ParDo(CountAverages())

4.  The calculated average values are written to the BigQuery average table. The table is created if it does not exist.

        'Write Avg to BigQuery' >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(
             args.output_avg,
             schema=Schema.get_avg_schema(),
             create_disposition=BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_IF_NEEDED,
             write_disposition=BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_APPEND))

## View results in BigQuery

1.  Ensure that the client from [Part 1](https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/ardu-pi-serial-part-1) is running and 
    posting data to Pub/Sub through IoT Core.
2.  Go to the [BigQuery UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) in the GCP Console.
3.  In the BigQuery menu, select your project `my_project_id`.
4.  Select the dataset `my_dataset`.
5.  Select the table `my_table`:
    1.  View the table schema.
    2.  See table details.
6.  Run the following queries to see the latest data:
    1.  Select the latest 20 records from the raw table:

            select * from [my_dataset].[my_table]
            order by timestamp DESC
            limit 20;
            
    2.  The average table adds a single row for each time window. Run the query below to select the latest 20 records.

            select * from [my_dataset].[my_avg_table]
            order by timestamp DESC
            limit 20;
