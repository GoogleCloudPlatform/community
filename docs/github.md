## Contributor license agreements

We'd love to accept your contributions! Before we can take them, we have to jump
over a few legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA][in_cla].
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA][corp_cla].

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.
