## Introduction

Beyond the official documentation there are endless possiblities for combining
tools, platforms, languages and products. Ultimately, everything you build is
unique, but very often projects share a lot in common. By submitting a tutorial
you can share your experience and help others who are solving similar problems.

Tutorials can be short or long, but in every case they provide context for
using Google Cloud Platform in the real world and show how to solve a particular
problem that may not have been discussed in the official documentation.

Community tutorials are stored in markdown files [on GitHub][github] where they
can be reviewed and edited by the community.

**To access the GitHub repository during the internal-only EAP, you need a
GitHub account that is a member of the GoogleCloudPlatform GitHub organization
and has read access to https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/community.**
